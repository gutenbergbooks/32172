<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE EARLY LITERATURE</h3>


<p>One Sunday morning, about the year 1661, a
group of Indians was gathered around a noble-looking
man, listening to a story he was reading.
It was summer and the day was beautiful, and the
little Indian children who sat listening were so interested
that not even the thought of their favorite
haunts by brookside or meadow could tempt
them from the spot. The story was about the
life of Christ and his mission to the world, and
the children had heard it many times, but to-day
it seemed new to them because it was read in
their own language, which had never been printed
before. This was the Mohegan tongue, which
was spoken in different dialects by the Indians
generally throughout Massachusetts; and although
it had been used for hundreds of years
by the tribes in that part of the country its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg 2]</span>
appearance on paper was as strange to them as if
it had been a language of which they knew not
a single word. It was just as strange to them,
in fact, as if they had heard one of their war
cries or love songs set to music, or had seen a
picture of their dreams of the happy hunting
grounds in that invisible western world where
the sun went every night, and which they expected
to see only after death.</p>

<p>The man who was reading the old story was
John Eliot, an English missionary, who had devoted
his life to the Indians, and whose ambition
it was to leave behind him as his greatest
gift the Bible translated into their own tongue.
With this in view he set about making them
familiar with the Christian faith, and established
Sunday-schools among them, where men, women,
and children alike were instructed.</p>

<p>From time to time they heard read stories from
the New Testament which Eliot had translated,
and in which he was greatly helped by one or
two Indians who had gifts as translators, and
could express the English thought into Indian
words more fitting and beautiful than Eliot himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg 3]</span>
could have done. In all his earlier missionary
work he also had the assistance of the great
sachem Waban, because, as it happened, the first
sermon Eliot ever preached to the Indians was
delivered in Waban's wigwam. The text was
from the old poetic words of Ezekiel&mdash;"Say to
the wind, Thus saith the Lord God," etc.</p>

<p>The Indian name for wind was Waban, the
old sachem's name, and he thought the sermon
was addressed to him. He became an ardent
convert and helped Eliot greatly in his work of
Christianizing the tribes, and in particular in his
trouble to keep peace among the sachems, who
objected to the freedom of thought which the
new religion taught, thinking that it interfered
with their own authority over their people.</p>

<p>In a little book in which Eliot describes these
grievances of the chiefs he calls them <i>Pills for
the Sachems</i>, and says they were much harder to
swallow than even the nauseous doses of their
medicine men.</p>

<p>For the better instruction of the Indian children
Eliot prepared a small primer, which was
printed in 1669, eight years after the New Testament
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span>
was printed. It was a curious little book,
having the alphabet in large and small letters on
the fly-leaf, and containing the Apostles' Creed,
the Catechism, and the Lord's Prayer, with other
religious matter. Out of this primer the Indian
youth learned to read and to spell in words of
one syllable. When he was able to master the
whole Bible, which was printed in 1663, his education
was considered complete.</p>

<p>This old Indian Bible, which Eliot was ten
years in translating, was printed at Cambridge
and bound in dark blue morocco, it being the
first Bible and one of the first books ever printed
in America. Two hundred copies were made,
and a second edition contained a dedication to
Charles II. of England, praising him for his
goodness in distributing the word of God among
his colonies, which had not yielded him gold and
silver as the Spanish colonies had yielded their
sovereign, but which would nevertheless redound
to his immortal glory as the first-fruits of Christianity
among those heathen tribes. The dedication
took up two pages, which was about all the
English the old book contained, the rest being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span>
in that curious, half-musical, half-guttural tongue
of the Mohegans, which Cotton Mather said had
been growing since the time of the confusion of
tongues at the Tower of Babel. Certainly some
of the words are of such mighty length and
awful sound that we may well believe the same
old preacher when he says that he knew from
personal knowledge that demons could understand
Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, but that they
were utterly baffled by the speech of the American
Indians.</p>

<p>Very few of these Bibles now exist, and those
are of priceless value to lovers of old books.</p>

<p>One of the earliest books that may be claimed
as belonging to American letters was a volume
descriptive of the early settlements in Virginia
by Captain John Smith. It has great value as a
representation of Indian life before its contact
with white civilization. Smith had followed the
army of England through the greater part of
Europe and Asia and knew the life of a soldier
of fortune. He had fought with Turks, hunted
Tartars, and had always been the hero of the
occasion. The Indian to him was but another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span>
kind of heathen to subdue, and the book is full
of adventures, in which he describes himself as
always intrepid and victorious. This is the earliest
book that brings the Indians of the colonies
closely before our eyes, and its style is good, and
shows that strong, terse, English fibre which characterized
the writings of the adventurous Englishman
of that time. In another book Smith gives
a charming description of inland Virginia, whose
birds, flowers, wild animals, rivers, and scenery
are discussed in a poetic fashion that throws a
new light on the character of the adventurous
soldier. There is in both volumes a richness of
description in the details of Indian life that possesses
a rare value to the student. The story of
Smith's visit to Powhatan, the father of Pocahontas,
reads like a bit of oriental fairy lore, and
the great Indian chief, seated upon his couch
of skins, with his savage guard around him, is
brought as vividly before our eyes as the hero
of a romance. And so Smith's books stand
for good literature, though written only with the
idea of familiarizing the people at home with
the condition of the new colony, and they make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg 7]</span>
no mean showing as the beginning of American
letters.</p>

<p>In New England literature from the first partook
inevitably of the Puritan character. There
were long journals of the pilgrim fathers, books
on books of sermons, and volume after volume
of argument on the burning religious questions
that had been heard in England since the first
Puritan defied the king and openly declared for
freedom of conscience. Among the most celebrated
of these old books is the <i>Bay Psalm Book</i>
of 1640, in which the psalms of David were done
into metre for the use of congregations. This
book, in which the beautiful Hebrew poetry is
tortured into the most abominable English, is a
fair example of the religious verse-making of the
day.</p>

<p>A curious book was the first almanac, published
at Cambridge in 1689, and which contained
prognostications of the weather, dates of
historical events, general news of the world, and
bits of poetry, having also blank spaces for the
use of the owner, who could either utilize them
for preserving his own verses, as Cotton Mather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg 8]</span>
did, or keep therein his accounts with his wig
maker and hair-dresser, as did that worthy Puritan
Thomas Prince.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest poet of those early times
was Anne Bradstreet, who wrote her famous
poems on the Assyrian, Persian, Grecian, and
Roman monarchies, and who was called the
tenth muse by an admiring public. These
works are long and learned, but they show less
the poetic spirit of the age than do the short
but pointed ballads that sprang up from time to
time and which indicated the popular feeling
over the events that were making the history of
New England. These ballads were on every
conceivable subject, from the Day of Judgment
to the sale of a cow. The war between England
and France for the possession of Canada gave
rise to many ditties the tunes of which remained
popular long afterward. The Indian wars also
furnished material for many. They were printed
in almanacs, or loose sheets, and sometimes not
printed at all. They served as news-venders
long before the first newspaper was published
(in 1690) and they expressed, as nothing else
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg 9]</span>
could have done, the attitude of the people toward
the church, the state, the governor, and
even the "tidy man" (tithing-man), whose duty
it was to tickle with a hazel rod any youngster
who was unlucky enough to fall asleep in
church. Later, in revolutionary times, the ballad
became a power second to none. Here first
appears that great hero Yankee Doodle, who
comes, like will-o'-the-wisp, from no one knows
where, although many learned pages have been
written to show his nationality. He seems to
have been as great a traveller as Marco Polo
or Baron Munchausen, and, like them, he must
have seen many strange sights and countries.
Perhaps he may have a trace of the gypsy in
him and could recall, if he liked, strange wanderings
through the Far East. He may have been
a camp-follower through the German and Flemish
wars. It is more than probable that he hobnobbed
with the Italian banditti, and took an
elfish delight in depriving honest travellers of
their wits and purses. We know that he lived
for a time in Holland, where he seems to have
preferred a peaceful life and was content with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span>
the humdrum existence of those worthy Dutch
farmers who invited him to their feasts, welcomed
him to their roofs, and sang his praises in their
harvest-fields in such stirring words as these:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Yanker didel doodel down,</p>
<p>Didel dudel lanter;</p>
<p>Yanke viver voover vown,</p>
<p>Botermilk un tanther;</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>which means that if the lads and lassies reaped
and gleaned faithfully they should be rewarded
by a tenth of the grain, and an unlimited supply
of buttermilk.</p>

<p>Afterward Yankee Doodle seems to have tired
of pastoral life, for we find him in the midst of
Roundhead and Cavalier upon the battle-fields
of England during the Civil War. No doubt
such a jolly comrade felt a tinge of sadness at
the misfortunes of the unlucky Charles I., and
he could not have found the long-faced Puritans,
with their nasal voices, very good company for
such a happy-go-lucky as himself. At any rate
he never became an Englishman, and seems only
to have paused in England while making up his
mind where to settle down and spend his old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span>
age. He probably made his first bow in America
in 1775, and it is evident that he took a fancy to
the new country, and was pleased, and perhaps
flattered, by the reception he met. With his old
abandon he threw himself heart and soul into
the conflict, and became, in fact, the child of the
Revolution. He was a leading spirit everywhere.
Throwing all recollections of English
hospitality to the winds, he chased the red coats
at Bunker Hill, gave them a drubbing at Bennington,
and remained bravely in the rear to
watch their scouts while Washington retreated
from Long Island. Many a time he was the
sole support of the faithful few stationed to
guard some important outpost; many a time he
marched along with the old Continentals, grim
and faithful, expecting every moment would reveal
danger and perhaps death.</p>

<p>He crossed the Delaware with Washington
on that eventful Christmas night, in 1775,
though the Italian blood in him must have
shrunk a little from the cold. He stood shoulder
to shoulder with the great leader through
all the misery and hopelessness of Valley Forge.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span>
He was joyously welcomed by the soldiers in all
their daring escapades when breaking loose from
the restraints of camp life; and the women and
children who had to remain home and suffer
danger and privation alone, never saw his honest
face without a smile.</p>

<p>Such devotion met with its reward. When the
war was over the old veteran retired from the service
with full military rank, and was brevetted an
American citizen besides. It is pleasant to think
that he has at last found a resting place among
a people who will always honor and love him.</p>

<p>Two other ballads very popular at that time
were <i>The Battle of Trenton</i> and <i>The Massacre
of Wyoming</i>, while innumerable ones of lesser
note were sung by fireside and camp-fire, all
through the colonies.</p>

<p>In New York the first liberty pole raised in
the country was planted by the Sons of Liberty,
a band of patriotic Americans, who set it up
again and again as it was cut down by the Tories,
accompanying their work by singing every imaginable
kind of ballad that would irritate the
breast of the British sympathizers.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span>

<p>During the war of 1812, came the <i>Star Spangled
Banner</i>, written to the accompaniment of
shot and shell, while the author, Francis S. Key,
was a prisoner on shipboard watching the bombardment
of Fort McHenry by the British, in
the harbor of Baltimore. The song was born
in the darkness of a night of terrible anxiety,
and when the dawn broke and found the flag
still floating over the fort, an earnest of the victory
to come, its triumphant measures seemed
the fitting p&#230;an of American liberty.</p>

<p>The ballad of the camps had developed into
the national anthem.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>JOHN JAMES AUDUBON</h3>

<h4>1780-1851</h4>


<p>In the days when Louisiana was a province of
Spain a little dark-eyed boy used to wander
among the fields and groves of his father's plantation
studying with eager delight the works of
nature around him.</p>

<p>Lying under the orange-trees watching the
mocking-bird, or learning from his mother's lips
the names of the flowers that grew in every corner
of the plantation, he soon came to feel that he
was part of that beautiful world, whose language
was the songs of birds and whose boundaries extended
to every place where a blossom lifted its
head above the green sod. To him, as he said
years afterward, the birds were playmates and
the flowers dear friends, and before he could distinguish
between the azure of the sky and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span>
emerald of the grass he had formed an intimacy
with them so close and endearing that whenever
removed from their presence he felt a loneliness
almost unbearable. No other companions suited
him so well, and no roof seemed so secure as that
formed of the dense foliage under which the
feathered tribes resorted, or the caves and rocks
to which the curlew and cormorant retired to
protect themselves from the fury of the tempest.
In these words, recorded by himself, we read the
first chapter of the life history of John James
Audubon, the American naturalist and the author
of one of the early classics of American literature.</p>

<p>In those early days his father was Audubon's
teacher, and hand in hand they searched the
groves for new specimens, or lingered over the
nests where lay the helpless young. It was his
father who taught him to look upon the shining
eggs as 'flowers in the bud,' and to note the different
characteristics which distinguished them.
These excursions were seasons of joy, but when
the time came for the birds to take their annual
departure the joy was turned to sorrow. To the
young naturalist a dead bird, though beautifully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span>
preserved and mounted, gave no pleasure. It
seemed but a mockery of life, and the constant
care needed to keep the specimens in good condition
brought an additional sense of loss. Was
there no way in which the memory of these
feathered friends might be kept fresh and beautiful?
He writes that he turned in his anxiety
to his father, who in answer laid before him a
volume of illustrations. Audubon turned over
the leaves with a new hope in his heart, and
although the pictures were badly executed the
idea satisfied him. Although he was unconscious
of it, it was the moment of the birth of his own
great life work. Pencil in hand he began to
copy nature untiringly, although for a long time
he produced what he himself called but a family
of cripples, the sketches being burned regularly
on his birthdays. But no failure could stop him.
He made hundreds of sketches of birds every
year, worthless almost in themselves because of
bad drawing, but valuable as studies of nature.</p>

<p>Meantime for education the boy had been
taken from Louisiana to France, the home of
his father, who wished him to become a soldier,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span>
sailor, or engineer. For a few hours daily Audubon
studied mathematics, drawing, and geography,
and then would disappear in the country,
returning with eggs, nests, or curious plants.
His rooms looked like a museum of natural history,
while the walls were covered with drawings
of French birds.</p>

<p>Learning mathematics with difficulty Audubon
became easily proficient in fencing and
dancing, and learned to play upon the violin,
flute, flageolet, and guitar. His drawing lessons
were his greatest delight, the great French artist,
David, being his teacher and critic. Once, on
the elder Audubon's return from a long sea-voyage,
he was chagrined to find that although his
son had probably the largest amateur natural-history
collection in France, he had neglected his
equations, angles, and triangles, and the lad was
sent to his father's station, given one day to visit
the ships and fortifications, and then set to the
study of mathematics, and mathematics only.</p>

<p>For one year he wrestled with problems and
theorems, counting himself happy if by any
chance he could fly to the country for an hour to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span>
take up his acquaintance with the birds; and
then the father admitted his son's unfitness for
military pursuits and sent him to America to
take charge of some property.</p>

<p>Audubon was then seventeen years of age,
and had but one ambition in life&mdash;to live in the
woods with his wild friends. As his father's estate
was rented by a very orderly minded Quaker
there was little for Audubon to do except enjoy
himself. Hunting, fishing, drawing, and studying
English from a young English girl he afterward
married, filled the day, while he never
missed the balls and skating parties for which
the neighborhood was famous. He was the best
marksman in the region, able to bring down his
quarry while riding at full speed. He was the
best skater to be found; at balls and parties he
was the amateur master of ceremonies, gayly
teaching the newest steps and turns that obtained
in France. In the hunt it was Audubon&mdash;dressed,
perhaps, in satin breeches and pumps, for he was
a great dandy&mdash;who led the way through the almost
unbroken wilderness. Add to this that he
was an expert swimmer, once swimming the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span>
Schuylkill with a companion on his back; that
he could play any one of half a dozen instruments
for an impromptu dance; that he could
plait a set of picnic dishes out of willow rushes;
train dogs, and do a hundred other clever things,
and it is easy to see why he was a general favorite.</p>

<p>His private rooms were turned into a museum.
The walls were covered with festoons of birds'
eggs, the shelves crowded with fishes, snakes,
lizards, and frogs; the chimney displayed stuffed
squirrels and opossums, and wherever there was
room hung his own paintings of birds. It was
the holiday of life for the young lover of nature,
and he enjoyed it with good will.</p>

<p>Here the idea of his great work came to him
as he was one day looking over his drawings and
descriptions of birds. Suddenly, as it seemed to
him, though his whole life had led to it, he conceived
the plan of a great work on American
ornithology. He began his gigantic undertaking
as a master in the school of nature wherein
he had been so faithful a student, for he now
saw with joy that the past, which had often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span>
seemed idle, had been in reality rich with labors
that were to bear fruit.</p>

<p>He began at once to put his work into scientific
form, and nothing better illustrates his energy
and ambition than the fact that he entered on
it alone and unaided, though none knew better
than he the toil and ceaseless endeavor necessary
for its completion. Except in a very immature
form, American ornithology at that time did not
exist; it was a region almost as unknown to human
thought as the new world which Columbus
discovered. Season after season, from the
Gulf to Canada and back again, these winged
creatures of the air wended their way, stopping
to hatch and breed their young, becoming acquainted
with Louisiana orange-groves and New
England apple-orchards, now fluttering with
kindly sociability round the dwellings of men
and again seeking lonely eeries among inaccessible
mountain tops, pursuing their course at all
times almost without the thought and cognizance
of man. It was Audubon who was the conqueror,
if not the discoverer of this a&#235;rial world
of song, of which he became the immortal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span>
historian. It was his untiring zeal which gave thus
early to American literature a scientific work of
such vast magnitude and importance that it astonished
the scientists of Europe and won for
itself the fame of being the most gigantic biblical
enterprise ever undertaken by a single individual.
To do this meant a life of almost constant
change, and Audubon can hardly have had
an abiding place after his first serious beginning.
The wide continent became his home and he
found his dwelling wherever the winged tribes
sought shelter from the wind and storm. His
pursuit was often interrupted by occupations
necessary for the support of his family, for at
his father's death he had given to his sister his
share of the estate and so became entirely dependent
upon his own efforts for a livelihood;
but at all times, no matter what his situation, his
heart was in the wild retreats of nature. Travelling
through the West and South in search
of fortune as well as of specimens his experiences
were often disenchanting. At Louisville
and New Orleans he would be forced to make
crayon portraits of the principal citizens in order
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span>
to raise the money for family expenses. Again
he taught drawing; he served as tutor in private
families, and in order to secure funds for
the publication of his work he earned $2,000
by dancing lessons, the largest sum he had
ever earned. Many business speculations enlisted
Audubon's hopes, but all failed utterly.
Once he embarked his money in a steam mill,
which, being built in an unfit place, soon failed.
At another time he bought a steamboat, which,
proving an unlucky speculation, was sold to a
shrewd buyer who never paid the purchase
money. Again he was cheated in the clearing
of a tract of timber. But his studies in natural
history always went on. When he had no money
to pay his passage up the Mississippi he bargained
to draw the portrait of the captain of the
steamer and his wife as remuneration. When
he needed boots he obtained them by sketching
the features of a friendly shoemaker, and more
than once he paid his hotel bills, and saved something
besides, by sketching the faces of the host
and his family.</p>

<p>On the other hand, his adventures in search
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span>
of material for his work were romantic enough
to satisfy the most ambitious traveller. From
Florida to Labrador, and from the Atlantic to
the then unknown regions of the Yellowstone he
pursued his way, often alone, and not seldom
in the midst of dangers which threatened life
itself. He hunted buffalo with the Indians of
the Great Plains, and lived for months in the
tents of the fierce Sioux. He spent a season
in the winter camp of the Shawnees, sleeping,
wrapped in a buffalo robe, before the great
camp-fire, and living upon wild turkey, bear's
grease, and opossums. He made studies of
deer, bears, and cougars, as well as of wild
turkeys, prairie hens, and other birds. For days
he drifted down the Ohio in a flat-bottomed
boat, searching the uninhabited shores for specimens,
and living the life of the frontiersman
whose daily food must be supplied by his own
exertions. Sometimes his studies would take
him far into the dense forests of the West, where
the white man had never before trod, and the
only thing that suggested humanity would be
the smoke rising miles away from the evening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span>
camp-fire of some Indian hunter as lonely as
himself.</p>

<p>Once as he lay stretched on the deck of a
small vessel ascending the Mississippi he caught
sight of a great eagle circling about his head.
Convinced that it was a new species, he waited
patiently for two years before he again had a
glimpse of it, flying, in lazy freedom, above some
butting crags where its young were nested.
Climbing to the place, and watching like an
Indian in ambush until it dropped to its nest,
Audubon found it to be a sea-eagle. He named
it the Washington Sea Eagle, in honor of George
Washington. Waiting two years longer, he was
able to obtain a specimen, from which he made
the picture given in his work. This is but one
example of the tireless patience with which he
prosecuted his studies, years of waiting counting
as nothing if he could but gain his end.</p>

<p>Some of his discoveries in this kingdom of
the birds he relates with a romantic enthusiasm.
Throughout the entire work there runs the note
of warmest sympathy with the lives of these
creatures of the air and sunshine. He tells us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span>
of their hopes and loves and interests, from the
time of the nest-making till the young have
flown away. The freedom of bird life, its happiness,
its experiences, and tragedies appeal to
him as do those of humanity. The discovery of
a new species is reported as rapturously as the
news of a new star. Once in Labrador, when
he was making studies of the eggers, his son
brought to him a great hawk captured on the
precipice far above his head. To Audubon's
delight, it was that rare specimen, the gerfalcon,
which had heretofore eluded all efforts of naturalists.
While the rain dripped down from the
rigging above, Audubon sat for hours making a
sketch of this bird and feeling as rich as if he
had discovered some rare gem.</p>

<p>After twenty years the work was published.
Every specimen, from the tiny humming-bird
to the largest eagles and vultures, was sketched
life size and colored in the tints of nature.
There were four hundred and seventy-five of
these plates, furnishing a complete history of
the feathered tribes of North America, for they
showed not only the appearance of the birds but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg 26]</span>
represented also the manners and home life of
this world of song. The humming-bird poised
before the crimson throat of the trumpet flower,
the whippoorwill resting among the leaves of the
oak, the bobolink singing among the crimson
flowers of the swamp maples, the snow-bird
chirping cheerily among the snow-touched berries
of the holly, were not sketches merely but
bits of story out of bird history. So also are
those pictures of the swan among the reeds of
the Great Lakes, of the great white heron seizing
its prey from the waters of the Gulf, and of
the golden eagle winging its way toward the
distant heights that it inhabits.</p>

<p>The work was published by subscription in
London in 1829 under the title, "The Birds of
North America." The price was eighty guineas.
Later on a smaller and cheaper edition was issued.
The work now is very rare. Audubon had the
gratification of knowing that his labors were understood
and appreciated by the world of science.
When he exhibited his plates in the galleries of
England and France, whither he went to obtain
subscriptions, crowds flocked to see them, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span>
the greatest scientists of the age welcomed him
to their ranks. <i>The Birds of America</i> was
his greatest work, though he was interested
somewhat in general zo&#246;logy and wrote on
other subjects.</p>

<p>Audubon died in New York in 1851. The
great zo&#246;logist Cuvier called <i>The Birds of
North America</i> the most magnificent monument
that art has ever erected to ornithology.
The Scotch naturalist Wilson said that the character
of Audubon was just what might have
been expected from the author of such a work,
brave, enthusiastic, self-sacrificing, and capable
of heroic endurance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>WASHINGTON IRVING</h3>

<h4>1783-1859</h4>


<p>"Left his lodging some time ago and has not
been heard of since, a small elderly gentleman,
dressed in an old black coat and cocked hat, by
the name of Knickerbocker. . . . Any information
concerning him will be thankfully received."</p>

<p>Such was the curious advertisement that appeared
in the <i>Evening Post</i> under the date of
October 26, 1809, attracting the attention of all
New York. People read it as they sat at supper,
talked of it afterward around their wood
fires, and thought of it again and again before
they fell asleep at night. And yet not a soul
knew the missing old gentleman or had ever
heard of him before. Still he was no stranger
to them, for he was a Knickerbocker, and everyone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span>
was interested in the Knickerbockers, and
everyone felt almost as if a grandfather or great-grandfather
had suddenly come back to life and
disappeared again still more suddenly without a
word of explanation.</p>

<p>Those who could remember their childhood
sent their wits back into the past and gathered
up memories of these old Knickerbockers.
They saw the old burghers again walking through
the streets dressed in their long-waisted coats
with skirts reaching nearly to the ankles, and
wearing so solemnly their low-crowned beaver
hats, while their small swords dangled by their
sides to show their importance. They saw their
wives in their close-fitting muslin caps, with their
dress-skirts left open to show their numerous
petticoats of every color, their gay stockings, and
their low-cut, high-heeled shoes. They entered
the quaint gabled houses made of brick brought
from Holland, and sat in the roomy kitchen
whose floor had just been sprinkled with sand
brought from Coney Island, and on whose walls
hung deer antlers and innumerable Dutch pipes.
They passed into the parlor, whose chief ornament
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span>
was the carved bedstead upon which reposed
two great feather-beds covered with a
patch-work quilt. They sat in the fireplace and
drank from the huge silver tankard while listening
to stories of Indian warfare. In the streets
they saw groups of Indians standing before the
shop windows, and passed by the walls of the
old fort wherein cows, pigs, and horses were
feeding. They noticed the queerly rigged ships
in the bay, the windmills scattered everywhere,
and the canal passing right through the town
and filled with Dutch canal boats. They saw
the Dutch maidens standing around the ponds
washing the family linen, and visited the bowerie
or country house of some honest burgher, and
sat with him in his little garden where cabbages
and roses flourished side by side.</p>

<p>Such were the scenes that the strange advertisement
called up, and more than one New
Yorker dreamed that night that he was a child
again, living over those long past days.</p>

<p>For some time nothing was heard of Diedrich
Knickerbocker, and then another advertisement
appeared in the <i>Post</i> saying he had been seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg 31]</span>
twice on the road to Albany. Some time again
elapsed, and finally the paper stated that the
landlord of the inn at which he stopped gave
up hope of ever seeing his guest again, and declared
that he should sell the manuscript of a
book that Mr. Knickerbocker had left behind
and take the proceeds in payment of his bill.
People were really excited about the fate of
the old gentleman, and one of the city officials
was upon the point of offering a reward for his
discovery when a curious thing happened. It
was found that there was no old gentleman by
the name of Knickerbocker who had wandered
away from his lodging; that there was no inn
at which he had lived, and no manuscript he
had left behind, and that in fact, Mr. Knickerbocker
was simply the hero of a book which
the author had taken this clever means of advertising.
The book claimed to be the true
history of the discovery and settlement of New
York, and began with an account of the creation
of the world, passing on to the manners, customs,
and historical achievements of the old Hollanders
from their first voyage in the celebrated ark the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span>
Good Vrow, to the shores of New Jersey. Here
we read how, as the Indians were given to long
talks and the Dutch to long silences, they had
no trouble about the settlement of the land, but
all lived peacefully together. How Oloffe Van
Kortlandt took his perilous journey from New
Jersey as far north as Harlem and decided to
build a city on Manhattan Island. Then we
read of the golden reign of the first Dutch
governor, Wouter Van Twiller, who was exactly
five feet six inches in height, and six feet five
inches in circumference, and who ate four hours
a day, smoked eight, and slept twelve, and so
administered the affairs of the colony that it was a
marvel of prosperity. Next we hear of Governor
Keift, of lofty descent, since his father was an
inspector of windmills&mdash;how his nose turned up
and his mouth turned down, how his legs were
the size of spindles, and how he grew tougher
and tougher with age so that before his death
he looked a veritable mummy. And then we
see the redoubtable Peter Stuyvesant stumping
around on his wooden leg adorned with silver
reliefs and follow him in his expedition against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg 33]</span>
the neighboring Swedish colonies, when the
entire population of the city thronged the streets
and balconies to wave farewell to him as he left,
and to welcome his return as a victorious conqueror.
Lastly we see him, furious with rage,
menacing the British fleet which has come to
take possession of the town, threatening vengeance
dire upon the English king, and still
cherishing his wrath with fiery bravery when the
enemy finally occupy the old Dutch town and
proceed to transform it into an English city.
The book was read with interest, admiration, or
amazement as the case might be. Some said it
appeared too light and amusing for real history,
others claimed that it held stores of wisdom that
only the wise could understand; others still complained
that the author was no doubt making
fun of their respectable ancestors and had written
the book merely to hold them up to ridicule.
Only a few saw that it was the brightest, cleverest
piece of humor that had yet appeared in
America, and that its writer had probably a
career of fame before him.</p>

<p>The author was Washington Irving, then a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span>
young man in his twenty-seventh year and
already known as the writer of some clever
newspaper letters, and of a series of humorous
essays published in a semi-monthly periodical
called <i>Salmagundi</i>.</p>

<p>Irving was born in New York on April 3,
1783, and was named after George Washington.
The Revolution was over, but the treaty of peace
had not yet been signed, and the British army
still remained in the city, which had been half
burned down during the war.</p>

<p>New York was then a small town, with a population
of about one seven-hundredth of what
it now has; beyond the town limits were orchards,
farms, country houses, and the high road leading
to Albany, along which the stage coach passed
at regular times. There were no railroads, and
Irving was fourteen years old before the first
steam-boat puffed its way up the Hudson River,
frightening the country people into the belief
that it was an evil monster come to devour them.
All travelling was done by means of sailing vessels,
stage coaches, or private conveyances; all
letters were carried by the stage-coach, and every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg 35]</span>
one cost the sender or receiver twenty-five cents
for postage. The telegraph was undreamed of,
and if any one had hinted the possibility of talking
to some one else a thousand miles away over
a telephone wire he would have been considered
a lunatic, or possibly a witch. In fact New York
was a quiet, unpretentious little town, whose inhabitants
were still divided into English or Dutch
families according to their descent, and in whose
households were found the customs of England
and Holland in full force. In Irving's family,
however, there was doubtless greater severity
practised in daily life than in the neighboring
households. The father was a Scotch Presbyterian
who considered life a discipline, who thought
all amusement a waste of precious time, and who
made the children devote one out of the two half
weekly holidays to the study of the catechism.
They were also obliged to attend church three
times every Sunday, and to spend any spare
moments left in reading some religious book, a
discipline which had such an effect upon Irving
that, to avoid becoming a Presbyterian, he went
secretly to Trinity Church and was confirmed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span>
Naturally Irving's love of fun was sedulously hid
from such a father, and, as fun he must have, he
sought amusement outside his own home. Forbidden
to attend the theatre, he would risk his
neck nightly by climbing out of his window to
visit the play for an hour or so, and then rush
home in terror lest his absence had been discovered
and his future fun imperilled. Many a
night when sent early to bed he would steal away
across the adjacent roofs to send a handful of
stones clattering down the wide, old-fashioned
chimney of some innocent neighbor, who would
start from his dreams to imagine robbers, spooks,
or other unpleasant visitors in his bed-chamber;
and often when Irving was supposed to be fast
asleep he was far away in the midst of a group of
truant boys concocting some scheme of mischief
which was meant to startle the neighborhood and
bring no end of fun to the daring perpetrators.</p>

<p>Irving went to school kept by an old Revolutionary
soldier, with whom he was a great favorite
and who always called him <i>General</i>. He was
not particularly brilliant in his studies, but he
distinguished himself as an actor in the tragedies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg 37]</span>
which the boys gave at times in the school-room;
at ten years of age he was the star of the company,
which did not even lose respect for him
when once, being called suddenly upon the stage
through a mistake, he appeared with his mouth
full of honey-cake, which he was obliged to swallow
painfully while the audience roared at the
situation. Afterward, when he rushed around
the stage flourishing a wooden sabre, he was not
a tragedian to be trifled with. The glory of it
even paid him for the cruelty of having to run
away to see a real play.</p>

<p>It was a favorite amusement with him after
school to wander down to the wharves, where
he would spend hours in watching the ships
load and unload, and dream of the day when
he, too, should visit those beautiful regions that
lay only in reach of their white sails; for, fond
as he was of boyish sports, he was much given
to day-dreams, and the romantic past of the old
world held a great charm for him. His favorite
books were "Robinson Crusoe," "The Arabian
Nights," "Gulliver's Travels," and all stories of
adventure and travel. The world beyond the sea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span>
seemed a fairyland to him; a little print of London
Bridge and another of Kensington Gardens,
that hung up in his bed-room, stirred his heart
wistfully, and he fairly envied the odd-looking
old gentlemen and ladies who appeared to be
loitering around the arches of St. John's Gate, as
shown in a cut on the cover of an old magazine.</p>

<p>Later his imagination was also kindled by
short excursions to the then wild regions of the
Hudson and Mohawk valleys. Drifting up the
Hudson in a little sloop, day after day the picturesque
beauty of the Highlands and Catskills
impressed itself more deeply upon him, while his
mind dwelt fondly upon the traditions which still
lingered around the mountains and rivers forever
associated with the struggles of the early settlers.
Years afterward we find the remembrance of
these days gracing with loving touch the pages
of some of his choicest work, and it is this power
of sympathy, so early aroused, that gives Irving
one of his greatest charms as a writer, and makes
the period of which he writes seem as real as if a
part of to-day.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span>

<p>At seventeen Irving left school and began to
study for the bar. But his health, which had
always been delicate, made it necessary for him
to take a long rest from study, and he accordingly
left America for two years of travel abroad. He
visited England, France, and Italy, taking great
delight in seeing those lands he had so often
dreamed of, in meeting the famous people of the
day, and, above all, in indulging in frequent visits
to the theatre and opera, becoming in this way
acquainted with all the great singers and actors
whose reputation had reached America. It was
after his return home that he brought out his
Knickerbocker history, a work which made him
so famous that when he returned to England
some time afterward he found himself very well
known in the best literary circles. The results
of this second visit are found in the volumes comprising
<i>Geoffrey Crayon's Sketch Book</i>, <i>Bracebridge
Hall</i>, <i>Tales of a Traveller</i> and other
miscellany, in which occur charming descriptions
of English country life, delightful ghost stories,
the famous description of an English Christmas,
the immortal legend of <i>Rip Van Winkle</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span>
and an account of a visit to the haunts of
Robin Hood, whose exploits had so fascinated
him as a boy that he once spent his entire holiday
money to obtain a copy of his adventures.</p>

<p><i>Abbotsford</i> is an account of a visit that Irving
paid to Sir Walter Scott. It is a charming
revelation of the social side of Scott's character,
who welcomed Irving as a younger brother
in art, became his guide in his visit to Yarrow
and Melrose Abbey, and took long rambling
walks with him all around the country made so
famous by the great novelist. Irving recalled as
among the most delightful hours of his life those
walks over the Scottish hills with Scott, who
was described by the peasantry as having "an
awfu' knowledge of history," and whose talk
was full of the folk-lore, poetry, and superstitions
that made up the interest of the place.</p>

<p>In the evening they sat in the drawing-room,
while Scott, with a great hound, Maida, at his
feet, read to them a scrap of old poetry or a
chapter from King Arthur, or told some delightful
bit of peasant fairy lore, like that of the black
cat who, on hearing one shepherd tell another of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span>
having seen a number of cats dressed in mourning
following a coffin, sprang up the chimney in
haste, exclaiming: "Then I am king of the cats,"
and vanished to take possession of his vacant
kingdom. From this time Irving's life was one
of constant literary labor for many years, all of
which were spent abroad. His works on the
companions of Columbus, and the Alhambra,
were written during his residence in Spain,
where he had access to the national archives and
where he became as familiar with the life of the
people as it was possible for a stranger to become.
He was at home both in the dignified circles of
higher life and among the picturesque and simple
peasantry, whose characteristics he draws with
such loving grace.</p>

<p>After seventeen years' absence Irving returned
to America, where he was welcomed as one who
had won for his country great honors. He was the
first writer to make American literature respected
abroad, and his return was made the occasion of
numerous f&#234;tes given in his honor in New York
and other cities. He now built Sunnyside, on the
Hudson, the home that he loved so dearly and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg 42]</span>
that will ever be famous as the abode of America's
first great writer.</p>

<p>His principal works following the Spanish
histories were <i>Astoria</i>, the history of the fur-trading
company in Oregon founded by the head
of the Astor family; <i>Captain Bonneville</i>, the adventures
of a hunter in the far West; the <i>Life
of Goldsmith</i> and the <i>Lives of Mahomet and
His Successors</i>.</p>

<p>He returned to Spain in 1842 as ambassador,
and remained four years. In the <i>Legends of
the Conquest of Spain</i> Irving tells the story of
the conquest of Spain by the Moors, as related
in the old Spanish and Moorish chronicles. The
pages are full of the spirit of the warfare of the
middle ages. Here we see the great Arab chieftain,
Taric, the one-eyed, with a handful of men
cruising along the Spanish coast to spy out its
strength and weakness, and finally making a bold
dash inland to capture and despoil a city and
return to Africa laden with plunder to report
the richness of the land. "Behold!" writes
Taric's chief in a letter to the Caliph, "a land
that equals Syria in its soil, Arabia in its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span>
temperature, India in its flowers and spices, and
Cathay in its precious stones."</p>

<p>And at this news the Caliph wrote back in
haste that God was great, and that it was evidently
his will that the infidel should perish, and bade
the Moors go forward and conquer.</p>

<p>In these delightful chapters we follow Taric
in his conquests from the taking of the rock of
Calpe, henceforth called from him Gibraltar, the
rock of Taric, to the final overthrow of the
Christians and the establishment of the Moorish
supremacy in Spain.</p>

<p>The whole story is a brilliant, living picture
of that romantic age. The Spanish king goes
to battle wearing robes of gold brocade, sandals
embroidered with gold and diamonds, and a crown
studded with the costliest jewels of Spain. He
rides in a chariot of ivory, and a thousand cavaliers
knighted by his own hand surround him,
while tens of thousands of his brave soldiers
follow him, guarding the sacred banners emblazoned
with the cross. The Moorish vanguard,
riding the famous horses of Arabia, advance to
the sound of trumpet and cymbal, their gay robes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg 44]</span>
and snowy turbans and their arms of burnished
gold and steel glittering in the sunshine, which
reflects in every direction the sacred crescent, the
symbol of their faith. The surroundings are
equally picturesque and romantic. The famous
plain of Granada, adorned with groves and gardens
and winding streams, and guarded by the
famous Mountains of the Sun and Air, forms
the foreground to the picture, while in the distance
we see the gloomy mountain passes, the
fortified rocks and castles, and the great walled
cities, through which the Moors passed, always
victorious and never pausing until their banners
floated from every cliff and tower.</p>

<p>Scattered through the narrative of battles and
sieges we find also many legends that abounded
at that time both in the Moslem and Christian
faiths, translated with such fidelity from the
old chroniclers that they retain all the supernatural
flavor of the original. Here we learn
how Arab and Christian alike beheld portents,
saw visions, received messages from the spirits,
and were advised, encouraged, and comforted by
signs and warnings from heaven, the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span>
narrative being most valuable as presenting in fine
literary form the every-day life and intense religious
fervor of the soldier of the middle ages.</p>

<p>For eight hundred years the Moors held Spain.
They built beautiful cities and palaces, the remains
of which are marvels to this day; they
made the plain of Granada a garden of flowers;
they preserved classical literature when the
rest of Europe was sunk in ignorance; they
studied the sciences, and had great and famous
schools, which were attended by the youth of all
nations; they rescued the Jewish people from
the oppression of the Spaniards, and made them
honorable citizens; and they impressed upon
their surroundings an art so beautiful that its influence
has extended throughout Christendom.
Their occupation of Spain at that time probably
did more for the preservation of literature,
science, and art than any other event in history.</p>

<p>In his chapters on the Alhambra, the beauties
of that celebrated palace, the favorite abode of
the Moorish kings, is described by Irving as
seen by him during a visit in 1829. Even at
that date, nearly four hundred <a name="four" id="four"></a>years after its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span>
seizure by the Spaniards, the Alhambra retained
much of its original magnificence. The great
courts, with their pavements of white marble,
and fountains bordered with roses, the archways,
balconies, and halls decorated with fretwork and
filigree and incrusted with tiles of the most exquisite
design; the gilded cupolas and panels of
lapis lazuli, and the carved lions supporting the
alabaster basins of the fountains, all appealed
to Irving so strongly that when he first entered
the palace it seemed, he relates, as if he had been
transported into the past and was living in an
enchanted realm.</p>

<p>Irving remained some months in the Alhambra,
living over again the scenes of Moorish
story, and so catching the spirit of the lost grandeur
of the old palace, that his descriptions read
like a bit of genuine Arabian chronicle, which
had been kept safe until then in the grim guardianship
of the past.</p>

<p>The chapters of the <i>Alhambra</i> are also full of
delightful legends, the fairy tales which time had
woven around the beautiful ruin, and which the
custodians of the place related gravely to Irving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg 47]</span>
as genuine history. It calls up a pleasant picture
to think of Irving sitting in the stately hall
or in his balcony, listening to one of these old
tales from the lips of his tattered but devoted
domestic, while the twilight was gathering and
the nightingale singing in the groves and gardens
beneath.</p>

<p>He himself said that it was the realization of
a day-dream which he had cherished since the
time when, in earliest boyhood on the banks of
the Hudson, he had pored over the story of
Granada.</p>

<p>In his work, <i>The Conquest of Granada</i>, Irving
relates the story of the retaking of Granada
by Ferdinand and Isabella, during a war which
lasted ten years and which held nothing but
disaster for the Moors. Ferdinand and Isabella
took the field with an army composed of the
nobles of Spain and their followers, and which
represented the chivalry of Europe, for all Christendom
hastened to espouse the holy cause of
driving the infidel from the land. The Spanish
camps glittered with the burnished armor and
gold-embroidered banners of foreign knights;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span>
and whether on the march, in the field, or in
camp, the whole pageant of the war as depicted
by Irving passes before our eyes like a brilliant
panorama. We see the Moorish king looking
down from the towers of the Alhambra upon
the plains once green and blooming but now
desolate with fire and sword by the hand of
Ferdinand. We follow the Moors as they rush
from their walls in one of their splendid but
hopeless sallies, to return discomfited, and hear
the wail of the women and old men&mdash;"Woe!
woe! to Granada, for its strong men shall fall
by the sword and its maidens be led into captivity."
We watch the Spaniards, tireless in
endeavor, building the fortified city of Santa
F&#233;, the city of holy faith, to take the place of
the camp destroyed by fire, and which has remained
famous as the place where Columbus
received from Isabella his commission to sail
westward until India was reached. And in the
end we see the Moors in their retreat looking
sadly from the hill which is called to this day,
The Last Sigh of the Moor, upon the beautiful
valley and mountains lost to them forever.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span>
So graphically is the scene described that Irving
must ever remain the historian of the Moors of
Spain, whose spirit seemed to inspire the beautiful
words in which he celebrated their conquests,
their achievements, and their defeats.</p>

<p>A favorite among Irving's books was the <i>Life
of Washington</i>, based upon the correspondence
of the great statesman. It is an appreciative
story of the life work of Washington, written
by one whose own work connected the past
and present, and who, as a child, had felt the
hand of the nation's hero laid upon his head in
blessing.</p>

<p>In the <i>Chronicle of Wolfert's Roost</i> Irving
follows in imagination old Diedrich Knickerbocker
into the famous region of Sleepy Hollow,
where much of the material for the celebrated
Knickerbocker's History was said to have been
collected. This chronicle, it was claimed, was
written upon the identical old Dutch writing
desk that Diedrich used; the elbow chair was
the same that he sat in; the clock was the very
one he consulted so often during his long hours
of composition. In these pages old Diedrich
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg 50]</span>
walks as a real person and Irving follows him
with faithful step through the region that he
loved so fondly all his life.</p>

<p>Everything here is dwelt upon with lingering
touch; the brooks and streams, the meadows
and cornfields, the orchards and gardens, and
the groves of beech and chestnut have each
their tribute from the pen of one who found
their charms ever fresh, who sought in them rest
and happiness, and who came back to them
lovingly to spend the last days of his life in
their familiar companionship.</p>

<p>Irving died in 1859 and was buried at Sunnyside,
in sight of the Hudson whose legends he
had immortalized and whose beauty never
ceased to charm him from the moment it first
captivated his heart in his boyhood days.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>JAMES FENIMORE COOPER</h3>

<h4>1789-1851</h4>


<p>The region of Otsego Lake, New York, was
at the last of the eighteenth century a wilderness.
Here and there rose a little clearing, the birthplace
of a future village, but westward the primeval
forest extended for miles around the little
lake, which reflected the shadows of wooded
hills on every side. Here roved deer, wolves,
panthers, and bears unmolested in the green
depths and following the same runways which
their species had trodden for centuries. Here
also lurked the red man, suspicious and cautious
and ever ready to revenge on the white man the
wrongs of his race.</p>

<p>In this beautiful spot lived the boy, James
Fenimore Cooper, in the family mansion built
by his father and named Otsego Hall, the starting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg 52]</span>
point of the now famous village of Cooperstown.
It was a fitting home for the boy who
was hereafter to immortalize the Indian race in
the pages of fiction. His life was almost as
simple as that of the Indian lads who roamed
through the forest fishing and hunting and knowing
no ambition beyond.</p>

<p>The little hamlet lay far away from the highways
of travel. The nearest villages were miles
distant and only to be reached on foot or on
horseback through miles of unbroken forest. A
visitor was rare, and meant perhaps a warning
that the Indians were on the war-path. Occasionally
a new settler drifted into the little
valley, and the village grew slowly through the
lad's boyhood, Otsego Hall keeping its dignity
as the Manor House. Sometimes a visitor of
note brought news of the great political troubles
in Europe, and thus Cooper met many men of
distinction whose visits seemed to bring the
great world very close to the little settlement.
This glimpse of a broader life, with attendance
at the village school and an intimate companionship
with nature, made up his early education.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span>
It was not bad training for the future novelist.
The acquaintanceship of celebrated men widened
his horizon and fed his imagination; his daily
life kept his mind fresh and active with the
spirit that was fast turning the uninhabited
regions of the frontier into busy settlements;
and the familiar intercourse with nature kept
pure the springs of poetry that lie in every
child's heart. He learned wood-lore as the young
Indian learned it, face to face with the divinities
of the forest. He knew the calls of the wild
animals far across the gloomy wilderness. He
could follow the deer and bear to their secluded
haunts. He could retrace the path of the retreating
wolf by the broken cobwebs glistening
in the early sunlight; and the cry of the panther
high overhead in the pines and hemlocks was a
speech as familiar as his own tongue. When he
was thirsty he made a hunter's cup of leaves and
drank in the Indian fashion. When fatigued he
lay down to rest with that sense of security that
comes only to the forest bred. When thoughtful
he could learn from the lap of the waves
against the shore, the murmur of leaves, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span>
rustle of wings, those lessons which nature
teaches in her quiet moods.</p>

<p>These experiences and impressions sank into
Cooper's heart, and were re-lived again long after
in the pages of his romances.</p>

<p>While still a boy Cooper went to Albany to
study, and in 1803 entered Yale College, at the
age of thirteen.</p>

<p>He played as much and studied as little as he
possibly could, and the first year's preparation
perhaps accounts for his dismissal from college
in his junior year. This in turn led to a life
much more to his liking. His father took his
part in the trouble at Yale, but was now anxious
to see his son embarked on the serious business
of life. Both father and son liked the idea of a
naval career for the boy, and it was decided that
Cooper should go to sea. He left New York
in the autumn of 1806 on a vessel of the merchant
marine. There was then no Naval Academy
in America, and a boy could fit himself for
entering the navy as an officer only by serving
before the mast. Cooper was away nearly a year,
his ship, the Sterling, visiting London, Portugal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span>
and Spain, carrying cargoes from one port to
another in the leisurely manner of the merchant
sailing-vessels of that day. It was a time of
peculiar interest to all seamen, and his mind was
keenly alive to the new life around him. The
English were expecting a French invasion, and
the Channel was full of ships of war, while every
southern port was arming for defence. The
Mediterranean was terrorized by the Barbary
pirates, who, under cover of night, descended
upon any unprotected merchant vessel, stole
the cargo, scuttled the ship, and sold the crew
into slavery, to Tripolitan and Algerine husbandmen,
whose orchards of date and fig were
cultivated by many an American or English
slave.</p>

<p>Cooper saw all this and remembered it, being
even then a student of men and events. His
work was hard and dangerous; he was never admitted
to the cabin of the ship; in storm or
wind his place was on the deck among the rough
sailors, who were his only companions. But
this training developed the good material that
was in him, and when in 1808 he received his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg 56]</span>
commission as midshipman he was well equipped
for his duties.</p>

<p>Cooper remained in the navy three years and
a half. He spent part of this time at the port
of Oswego, Lake Ontario, superintending the
building of a war vessel, the Oneida, intended
for the defence of the Canadian frontier in case
of a war with England. The days passed in
this wild region were not fruitless, for here in
the solitude of the primeval forest Cooper found
later the background of a famous story. It was
the land of the red man, and during the long
winter months of his residence there Cooper
dwelt in spirit with the wild natives, though he
little dreamed that he was to be the historian
that would give the story of their lives to a
succeeding generation. Cooper saw no active
service during the time, and resigned his commission
on his marriage.</p>

<p>Several succeeding years were passed partly in
Westchester County, his wife's former home, and
partly in Cooperstown. Here he began the
erection of a stone dwelling, in Fenimore, a suburb
of the old village. While living at Scarsdale,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span>
Westchester County, N. Y., he had produced
his first book. Already thirty years old,
a literary career was far from his thoughts. This
first novel was merely the result of a challenge
springing from a boast. Reading a dull tale of
English life to his wife, he declared that he
could write a better story himself, and as a result
produced a tale in two volumes, called <i>Precaution</i>.
It was founded upon English society
life, and it obtained some favorable notices from
English papers. But it showed no real talent.
But in the next year, 1821, he published a story
foreshadowing his fame and striking a new note
in American literature. At that time Americans
still cherished stirring memories of the Revolution.
Men and women could still recall the victories
of Bunker Hill and Trenton, and the disasters
of Monmouth and Long Island.</p>

<p>Cooper's own first impressions of life were
vivid with the patriotism that beat at fever heat
during his youth, when the birth of American
independence was within the recollection of
many. In choosing a subject for fiction Cooper
therefore naturally turned to the late struggle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span>
and American literature owes him a large debt
for thus throwing into literary form the spirit of
those thrilling times. This novel, <i>The Spy</i>,
was founded upon the story of a veritable spy
who had been employed by the Revolutionary
officer who related to Cooper some of his daring
adventures. Taking this scout for a hero Cooper
kept the scene in Westchester and wove from a
few facts the most thrilling piece of fiction that
had yet appeared in the United States. The
novel appeared in December, 1821, and in a few
months it had made Cooper famous both in
America and Europe. It was published in England
by the firm which had brought out Irving's
<i>Sketch Book</i>, and it met with a success that
spoke highly for its merit, since the story described
English defeat and American triumphs.
The translator of the Waverley novels made a
French version, and before long the book appeared
in several other European tongues, while
its hero, Harvey Birch, won and has kept for
himself an honorable place in literature.</p>

<p>Cooper had now found his work, and he continued
to illustrate American life in fiction.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span>
His most popular books are the <i>Leather Stocking
Tales</i> and his novels of the sea. The
<i>Leather Stocking Tales</i> consist of five stories,
<i>The Deerslayer</i>, <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i>,
<i>The Pathfinder</i>, <i>The Pioneers</i>, and <i>The Prairie</i>,
concerning the same hero, Leatherstocking.</p>

<p>In <i>The Deerslayer</i> the hero of the series
makes his appearance as a youth of German descent
whose parents had settled near a clan of
the Mohegans on the Schoharie River. At a
great Indian feast he receives the name Deerslayer
from the father of Chingachgook, his Indian
boy friend, and the story is an account of
his first war-path. The tale was suggested to the
author one afternoon as he paused for a moment
while riding to gaze over the lake he so loved,
and whose shores, as he looked, seemed suddenly
to be peopled with the figures of a vanished race.
As the vision faded he turned to his daughter
and said that he must write a story about the little
lake, and thus the idea of Deerslayer was
born. In a few days the story was begun. The
scene is laid on Otsego Lake, and in the tale are
incorporated many tender memories of Cooper's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span>
own boyhood. It portrays Leatherstocking as a
young scout just entering manhood, and embodies
some of the author's best work. Perhaps
no one was so well-fitted to illustrate the ideal
friendship between Deerslayer and Chingachgook
as he, who in his boyhood stood many a time beside
the lakeside as the shadows fell over the
forest, not knowing whether the faint crackling
of the bushes meant the approach of the thirsty
deer, or signalled the presence of some Indian
hunter watching with jealous eye the white
intruder.</p>

<p>In <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i>, Leatherstocking,
under the name Hawkeye, is represented
in the prime of manhood, his adventures forming
some of the most exciting events of the series.
Here his old friend Chingachgook and the latter's
son Uncas follow Deerslayer hand in hand,
and make, next to the hero, the principal characters
of the story, the scene of which is laid near
Lake Champlain during the trouble between the
French and English for the possession of Canada.</p>

<p>In <i>The Pathfinder</i> the famous scout, under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg 61]</span>
the name which gives the title to the book, is
carried still further in his adventurous career.
The scene is laid near Lake Ontario where
Cooper spent some months while in the navy.
These three tales are not only the finest of the
series from a literary standpoint, but they illustrate
as well the life of those white men of the
forest who lived as near to nature as the Indian
himself and whose deeds helped make the history
of the country in its beginnings.</p>

<p><i>The Pioneers</i> finds Leatherstocking an old
hunter living on Otsego Lake at the time of its
first settlement by the whites. The character
was suggested by an old hunter of the regions
who in Cooper's boyhood came frequently to the
door of his father's house to sell the game he had
killed. The hero is in this book called Natty
Bumppo and the story is one of the primitive
life of the frontiersmen of that period. Their
occupations, interests and ambitions form the
background to the picture of Leatherstocking,
the rustic philosopher, who has finished the
most active part of his career, and who has
gathered from nature some of her sweetest lessons.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg 62]</span>
Many of the scenes in the book are <a name="book" id="book"></a>transcriptions
from the actual life of those hardy
pioneers who joined Cooper's father in the settlement
of Cooperstown, while the whole is tinged
with that tender reminiscence of the author's
youth which sets it apart from the rest though it
is, perhaps, the least perfect story of the series.</p>

<p>Leatherstocking closes his career in <i>The
Prairie</i>, a novel of the plains of the great West,
whither he had gone to spend his last days. It
is the story of the lonely life of the trapper of
those days, whose love of solitude has led him
far from the frontier, and whose dignified death
fitly closes his courageous life. It is supposed
that the actual experiences of Daniel Boone suggested
this ending to the series.</p>

<p>The story of the war of the frontiersmen with
nature, with circumstances and with the red man
is told in these books. It is the romance of real
history and Leatherstocking was but the picture
of many a brave settler whose deeds were unrecorded
and whose name remains unknown. Side
by side with Leatherstocking stand those Indian
characters which the genius of Cooper immortalized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg 63]</span>
and which have passed into history as
typical.</p>

<p>Cooper began the tales without any thought
of making a series, but the overwhelming success
of <i>The Pioneers</i>, the first which appeared,
led him to produce book after book until the
whole life of the hero was illustrated.</p>

<p>Cooper's series of sea novels began with <i>The
Pilot</i>, published in 1824. It followed <i>The Pioneers</i>,
and showed the novelist to be equally
at home on sea and land. In his stories of frontier
life, Cooper followed the great Scott, whose
thrilling tales of Border life and of early English
history had opened a new domain to the novelist.
Cooper always acknowledged his debt to the
great <i>Wizard of the North</i>, and, indeed, spoke
of himself as a chip of Scott's block. But in his
sea stories Cooper was a creator. He was the
first novelist to bring into fiction the ordinary,
every-day life of the sailor afloat, whether employed
on a peaceful merchant vessel or fighting
hand to hand in a naval battle. And it is interesting
to know that the creation of the sea story
was another debt that he owed to Scott, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg 64]</span>
in a far different way. Scott's novel, <i>The Pirate</i>,
had been criticised by Cooper as the work
of a man who had never been at sea. And to
prove it the work of a landsman he began his
own story, <i>The Pilot</i>. The time chosen is
that of the Revolution, and the hero is the famous
adventurer John Paul Jones, introduced under
another name. It was so new a thing to use the
technicalities of ship life, and to describe the
details of an evolution in a naval battle, that,
familiar as he was with ocean life, Cooper felt
some doubts of his success. To test his power
he read one day to an old shipmate that now
famous account of the passage of the ship
through the narrow channel. The effect was
all that Cooper hoped. The old sailor fell into
a fury of excitement, paced up and down the
room, and in his eagerness for a moment lived
over again a stormy scene in his own life.
Satisfied with this experiment Cooper finished
the novel in content.</p>

<p><i>The Pilot</i> met with an instant success both
in America and Europe. As it was his first, so
it is, perhaps, his best sea story. Into it he put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg 65]</span>
all the freshness of reminiscence, all the haunting
memories of ocean life that had followed him
since his boyhood. It was biographical in the
same sense as <i>The Pioneers</i>. A part of the
romance of childhood drafted into the reality of
after life.</p>

<p><i>The Red Rover</i>, the next sea story, came
out in 1828. By that time other novelists were
writing tales of the sea, but they were mere
imitations of <i>The Pilot</i>. In <i>The Red Rover</i>
the genuine adventures of the sailor class were
again embodied in the thrilling narrative that
Cooper alone knew how to write, and this book
has always been one of the most popular of
novels.</p>

<p>The Red Rover, so called because of his red
beard, and whose name gives the title to the
book, is a well born Englishman who has turned
pirate, and whose daring adventures have made
him famous along the coasts of America, Europe
and Africa. The scene opens in the harbor of
Newport in the days when that town was the
most important port of the Atlantic coast, and
from there is carried to the high seas, whereon is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span>
fought that famous last sea fight of the Red
Rover, the description of which forms one of
Cooper's best efforts.</p>

<p><i>Wing and Wing</i> is a tale of the Mediterranean
during the exciting days of privateers and
pirates in the latter part of the eighteenth century.
The great admiral, Nelson, is introduced
in this book, which abounds with incidents of the
tropical seas and reflects much of Cooper's experience
during his apprenticeship on the Sterling.
The story is one of Cooper's masterpieces,
and, like so much of his work, has preserved in
literature a phase of life that has forever passed
away.</p>

<p>In <i>The Two Admirals</i> is introduced, for the
first time in fiction, a description of the evolution
of great fleets in action. The scene is taken
from English history, and in many instances the
story shows Cooper at his best.</p>

<p><i>The Water Witch</i>, and <i>Ned Myers, or Life
Before the Mast</i>, a biography almost of Cooper's
own early life at sea, must be included among
the tales which illustrate the author's genius as a
writer of tales of the sea.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg 67]</span>

<p>Nothing can be more different than the picture
of Leatherstocking and his Indian friends in
the forest retreats of nature and that of the reckless
sailor race which found piracy and murder
the only outcome for their fierce ambitions. Yet
both are touched with the art of a master, and
both illustrate Cooper's claim as one of the
greatest masters of fiction.</p>

<p>Besides his <i>Leather Stocking Tales</i> and the
sea stories Cooper wrote novels, sketches of travel,
essays on the social and political condition
of America, and innumerable pamphlets in answer
to attacks made upon him by adverse critics.
But his rank in American literature will ever be
determined by the <i>Leather Stocking Tales</i> and
his best sea stories. His place is similar to that
of Scott in English literature, while he enjoys
also the reputation of having opened a new and
enchanted realm of fiction.</p>

<p>Next to Hawthorne, he will long be held, probably,
the greatest novelist that America has produced.
With the exception of seven years abroad,
Cooper spent his life in his native land. While
in Europe he wrote some of his best novels, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span>
though he grew to love the old world he never
wavered in his devotion to America.</p>

<p>Cooper's popularity abroad was equalled only
by that of Scott. His works were translated and
sold even in Turkey, Persia, Egypt and Jerusalem
in the language of those countries. It was
said by a traveller that the middle classes of
Europe had gathered all their knowledge of
American history from Cooper's works and that
they had never understood the character of
American independence until revealed by this
novelist. In spite of defects of style and the
poor quality of some of his stories, Cooper has
given to fiction many creations that must live as
long as literature endures.</p>

<p>He died in his sixty-second year at Cooperstown.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT</h3>

<h4>1794-1878</h4>


<p>William Cullen Bryant was born in 1794 in a
log farmhouse in the beautiful Berkshire Hills
of Western Massachusetts. His father was the
country doctor and the child was named after a
celebrated physician. He began his school days
in a log school-house beside a little brook that
crept down from the hills and went singing on
its way to the valley.</p>

<p>All around stood the great forest-covered hills,
haunted by wolves, bears, deer and wild-cats,
which occasionally crept down even to the settlements
carrying terror to the hearts of the
women and children. Wherever the slopes were
cleared, the farm lands had taken possession, the
forest often creeping up close to the little homes.</p>

<p>From the door-yard of the Bryant homestead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span>
the whole world seemed to be made up of hills
and forest, and fertile fields, while in the woods
grew the exquisite New England wild flowers,
the laurel and azalea, the violet, the tiger lily,
and the fringed gentian. Here also lived the
summer birds of New England, the robins, the
blue bird and the thrush, haunting the woods
from early spring until late autumn.</p>

<p>All these sights and sounds sunk into the
boy's heart and made themselves into a poem
which he wrote down in words many years after,
and which is as clear and fresh as the voice of
the little brook itself after which it was named.
This poem is called <i>The Rivulet</i> and it shows
the poet-child standing upon the banks of the
little stream listening to the song of the birds or
gathering wild flowers.</p>

<p>It was his first lesson in that wonder-book of
nature from which he translated so much that
was beautiful that he became the distinctive
poet of the woods and streams.</p>

<p>Lessons from books he learned in the little
log school-house, preparing himself for ordeals
when the minister came to visit the school. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg 71]</span>
these times the pupils were dressed in their best
and sat in solemn anxiety while the minister
asked them questions out of the catechism and
made them a long speech on morals and good
behavior. On one of these occasions the ten-year-old
poet declaimed some of his own verses
descriptive of the school.</p>

<p>In Bryant's boyhood New England farm life
was very simple. The farmers lived in log or
slab houses, whose kitchens formed the living
room, where the meals were generally taken.
Heat was supplied by the great fireplaces that
sometimes filled one whole side of the kitchen
and were furnished with cranes, spits, and pothooks.
Behind the kitchen door hung a bundle
of birch rods with which mischievous boys were
kept in order, and in the recess of the chimney
stood the wooden settle where the children sat
before bed-time to watch the fire or glance up
through the wide chimney at the stars.</p>

<p>Here, when three years old, Bryant often
stood book in hand and with painful attention
to gesture repeated one of Watts's hymns, while
his mother listened and corrected. Here he prepared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg 72]</span>
his lessons, and wrote those first childish
poems so carefully criticised by his father, who
was his teacher in the art of composition. In
the poem called <i>A Lifetime</i> Bryant long afterward
described many incidents of his childhood
and the influence of his father and mother upon
his art, one developing his talent for composition,
and the other directing his imagination to
and enlisting his sympathies with humanity.
This poem shows the boy by his mother's knee,
reading the story of Pharaoh and the Israelites,
of David and Goliath, and of the life of Christ.
As he grew older Bryant shared the usual
amusements of country life. In the spring he
took his turn in the maple-sugar camp; in the
autumn he attended the huskings when the
young people met to husk the corn in each
neighborhood barn successively, until all was
done. He helped at the cider-making bees,
and the apple parings, when the cider and apple
sauce were prepared for the year's need; and at
the house raisings, when men and boys raised the
frame of a neighbor's house or barn. In those
times the farmers depended upon each other for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg 73]</span>
such friendly aid, and the community seemed
like one great family.</p>

<p>On Sunday everyone went three times to meeting,
listened to long sermons, and sang out of
the old Bay Psalm Book. If any unlucky child
fell asleep he was speedily waked up by the tithingman,
who would tickle his nose with a hare's-foot
attached to a long pole. Once in a while a
boy might be restless or noisy, and then he was
led out of the meeting-house and punished with
the tithingman's rod, a terrible disgrace.</p>

<p>Throughout his childhood Bryant wrote
verses upon every subject discussed in the
family, and in those days New England families
discussed all the great events of the time. The
listening children became public-spirited and patriotic
without knowing it. At thirteen Bryant
wrote a most scathing satire upon the policy
of Thomas Jefferson, intended to make the
President hang his head in shame. It was
quoted in all the newspapers opposed to Jefferson,
and a second edition of this pamphlet
was called for in a few months. Bryant
here prophesies the evils in store for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg 74]</span>
country if the President insisted on the embargo
that was then laid upon American vessels,
and advises him to retire to the bogs of
Louisiana and search for horned frogs; advice
which Jefferson did not feel called upon to follow.
It was Bryant's first introduction to the
reading public, but it was not that path in literature
that he was destined to follow. Only one
or two of his earliest verses give any hint of the
poet of nature, though it was during this time
that he absorbed those influences that directed
his whole life. It is from the retrospective
poem, <i>Green River</i>, that we really know the
boy Bryant to whom the charm of sky and wood
and singing brook was so unconscious that it
seemed a part of life itself. In <i>Green River</i>,
written after he became a man, we hear the
echoes of his young days, and we know that the
boy's soul had already entered into a close communion
with nature.</p>

<p>But Bryant had not yet reached manhood
when the true voice of his heart was heard in the
most celebrated poem that he ever wrote, and
one of the most remarkable ever written by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span>
youth. This was <i>Thanatopsis</i>, which his father
discovered among his papers and sent to the
<i>North American Review</i> without his son's
knowledge, so little did the poet of eighteen,
who five years before had published the tirade
against Jefferson, realize that he had produced
the most remarkable verses yet written in
America.</p>

<p><i>Thanatopsis</i> attracted instant attention in this
country and in England. It had appeared
anonymously, and American critics insisted that
it could not be the work of an American author
as no native poet approached it either in sublimity
of thought or perfection of style. But
<i>Thanatopsis</i> bears no trace of English influence,
nor was it strange that an heir of the Puritan
spirit, who had lived in daily communion with
nature, should thus set to the music of poetry
the hopes and inspirations of his race.</p>

<p><i>Thanatopsis</i> is the first great American
poem, and it divides by a sharp line the poetry
hitherto written on our soil from that which was
to follow. Henceforth the poets of the newer
England ceased to find their greatest inspiration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg 76]</span>
in the older land. At the time of the publication
of the poem Bryant was studying law in
Great Barrington, Mass., having been obliged
by poverty to leave college after a two years'
course. It was in the brief interval before beginning
his office studies that he wrote <i>Thanatopsis</i>
putting it aside for future revision.</p>

<p>He was already hard at work upon his profession
when his sudden literary success changed all
his plans. Destined by nature to be a man of
letters, he poured forth verse and prose during
the whole time he was studying and practising
law. Six months after the publication of <i>Thanatopsis</i>
the poem entitled <i>To a Waterfowl</i>, suggested
by the devious flight of a wild duck across
the sunset sky, appeared.</p>

<p>It is a perfect picture of the reedy river banks,
the wet marshes, and the lonely lakes over which
the bird hovered, and it is full of the charm of
nature herself. From this time on Bryant's
touch never faltered. He was the chosen poet
of the wild beauty of his native hills and valleys,
and his own pure spirit revealed the most
sacred meanings of this beauty.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span>

<p>In 1821 he published his first volume of poems
under the title, <i>Poems by William Cullen Bryant</i>.
It was a little book of forty pages, containing
<i>Thanatopsis</i>, <i>Green River</i>, <i>To a Waterfowl</i>,
and other pieces, among which was the
charming, <i>The Yellow Violet</i>, a very breath of
the spring. This little book was given to the
world in the same year in which Cooper published
<i>The Spy</i> and Irving completed <i>The Sketch
Book</i>.</p>

<p>In 1825 Bryant removed to New York to assume
the editorship of a monthly review, to
which he gave many of his best-known poems.
A year later he joined the staff of the <i>Evening
Post</i>, with which he was connected until his
death.</p>

<p>From this time his life was that of a literary
man. He made of the <i>Evening Post</i> a progressive,
public-spirited newspaper, whose field embraced
every phase of American life. When he
became its editor five days were required for the
reports of the Legislature at Albany to reach
New York, these being carried by mail coach.
The extracts printed from English newspapers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg 78]</span>
were a month old, and even this was considered
enterprising journalism. All the despatches from
different cities of the United States bore dates a
fortnight old, while it was often impossible to
obtain news at all. The paper contained advertisements
of the stage lines to Boston, Philadelphia,
and the West; accounts of projects to
explore the centre of the earth by means of
sunken wells; reports of the possibility of a
railroad being built in the United States; advertisements
of lottery tickets; a list of the unclaimed
letters at the post-office, and usually a
chapter of fiction. Such was the newspaper of
1831.</p>

<p>During the fifty-two years of his editorship
the United States were developed from a few
struggling colonies bound together by common
interests into one of the greatest of modern
nations. And through all the changes incident
to this career Bryant stood always firm to the
principles which he recognized as the true foundations
of a country's greatness.</p>

<p>When he was born the United States consisted
of a strip of land lying between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg 79]</span>
Atlantic and the Alleghany Mountains, of which
more than half was unbroken wilderness. At
his death the Republic extended from the Atlantic
to the Pacific and from the Gulf to Canada.
His life-time corresponded with the growth of
his country, and his own work was a noble contribution
to the nation's prosperity. In all times
of national trouble the <i>Evening Post</i> championed
the cause of justice, and Bryant was everywhere
respected as a man devoted above all to the
"cause of America and of human nature."</p>

<p>The conduct of the <i>Evening Post</i> did not,
however, interfere with his work as a poet, and
in 1832 he published in one volume all the
poems which he had written, most of which had
previously appeared in magazines. A few
months later an edition appeared in London
with an introduction by Irving. It was this
volume which gave Bryant an English reputation
as great as that he enjoyed in America.
Like Cooper, he revealed an unfamiliar nature
as seen in American forests, hills, and streams,
taking his readers with him into those solitary
and quiet places where dwelt the wild birds and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span>
wild flowers. The very titles of his poems show
how closely he lived to the life of the world
around him. <i>The Walk at Sunset</i>, <i>The West
Wind</i>, <i>The Forest Hymn</i>, <i>Autumn Woods</i>, <i>The
Death of the Flowers</i>, <i>The Fringed Gentian</i>,
<i>The Wind and Stream</i>, <i>The Little People of the
Snow</i>, and many others disclose how Bryant
gathered from every source the beauty which he
translated into his verses.</p>

<p>Among the poems which touch upon the
Indian traditions are <i>The Indian Girl's Lament</i>,
<i>Monument Mountain</i>, and <i>An Indian at the
Burial-place of his Father</i>. In these he lingers
upon the pathetic fate of the red man driven
from the home of his race and forced into exile
by the usurping whites. They are full of sadness,
seeming to wake once again the memories
of other times when the forest was alive with
the night-fires of savage man and the days
brought only the gladness of freedom.</p>

<p>Besides his original work Bryant performed a
noble task in the translation of the <i>Iliad</i> and
<i>Odyssey</i> of Homer. He was over seventy when
he began this work, and was five years in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg 81]</span>
completing it. The poems are put into blank verse,
of which Bryant was a master, and they have
caught the very spirit of the old Greek bard; so
faithfully did the modern poet understand that
shadowy past that he might have watched with
Helen the burning of Troy, or journeyed with
Ulysses throughout his wanderings in the perilous
seas.</p>

<p>The light of Bryant's imagination burned
steadily to the end. In his eighty-second year
he wrote his last important poem, <i>The Flood of
Years</i>. It is a beautiful confession of faith in
the nobility of life and the immortality of the
soul, and a fitting crown for an existence so
beneficent and exalted.</p>

<p>His last public work was to participate in
unveiling a monument to the Italian statesman
Mazzini in Central Park, when he was the orator
of the day. On the same evening he was seized
with his last illness. He died on June 12, 1878,
and was buried at Roslyn, Long Island, one of
his favorite country homes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>WILLIAM H. PRESCOTT</h3>

<h4>1796-1859</h4>


<p>One of the stories that mankind has always
liked to believe is that of the existence of a marvellous
country whose climate was perfect, whose
people were happy, whose king was wise and
good, and where wealth abounded. The old
travellers of the Middle Ages dreamed of finding
this land somewhere in the far East. Many
books were written about it, and many tales told
by knight and palmer of its rivers of gold, mines
of precious stones, and treasure vaults of inexhaustible
riches. But, although from time to
time some famous traveller like Marco Polo or
Sir John Mandeville described the great wealth
of Ormus or Cathay, yet no one ever found the
real country of his imagination, and the dream
passed down from generation to generation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span>
unfulfilled. The Spaniards called this country <i>El
Dorado</i>, and perhaps their vision of it was the
wildest of all, for not only were they to find
inexhaustible riches, but trees whose fruit would
heal disease, magic wells which yielded happiness,
and fountains of immortal youth. Thus
dreamed the Spaniard of the fifteenth century,
and when Columbus found the new world it was
believed that it included El Dorado. Leader
after leader mustered his knights and soldiers
and sought the golden country. They traversed
forests, climbed mountains, forded rivers, and
waded through swamps and morasses; they suffered
hunger, thirst, and fever, and the savage
hostility of the Indians; they died by hundreds
and were buried in unmarked graves, and expedition
after expedition returned to Spain to report
the fruitlessness of their search. But the
hope was not given up. New seekers started
on the quest, and it seemed that the ships of
Spain could hardly hold her eager adventurers.</p>

<p>In a strange way this dream of El Dorado
was realized. Two soldiers of fortune, bolder,
hardier, luckier than the rest, actually found not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span>
one country but two, which were in part at
least like the golden world they sought. High
upon the table-land of Mexico and guarded by
its snow-capped mountains they found the kingdom
of the Aztecs, with their vast wealth of gold
and silver. Safe behind the barrier of the Andes
lay the land of the Incas, whose riches were,
like those of Ophir or Cathay, not to be measured.
Both of these countries possessed a strange
and characteristic civilization. In fact, even to
this day, scholars are puzzled to know the source
of the knowledge which these people possessed.</p>

<p>In Mexico Hernando Cortez found a government
whose head was the king, supported by a
tribunal of judges who governed the principal
cities. If a judge took a bribe he was put to
death. In the king's tribunal the throne was
of gold inlaid with turquoises. The walls were
hung with tapestry embroidered with figures of
birds and flowers. Over the throne was a canopy
flashing with gold and jewels. There were
officers to escort prisoners to and from court,
and an account of the proceedings was kept in
hieroglyphic paintings. All the laws of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg 85]</span>
kingdom were taught by these paintings to the
people. The Aztecs had orders of nobility and
knighthood; they had a military code and hospitals
for the sick. Their temples glittered with
gold and jewels, and they had ceremonies of
baptism, marriage, and burial. They had monastic
orders, astrologists and astronomers, physicians,
merchants, jewellers, mechanics, and husbandmen.
Their palaces were treasure-houses
of wealth. In fact, they were as unlike the
Indians of the eastern coast of America as the
Englishman of to-day is unlike the half-naked
savage who in the early ages roamed through
England, subsisting upon berries and raw flesh.</p>

<p>In Peru Francisco Pizarro found a great and
powerful empire, ruled over by a wise sovereign.
In the whole length and breadth of the land not
one poor or sick person was left uncared for by
the state. Great highways traversed mountain
passes and crossed ravines and precipices to the
most distant parts of the kingdom. Huge
aqueducts of stone carried the mountain streams
for hundreds of miles to the plains below. Massive
fortresses, whose masonry was so solid that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span>
it seemed part of the mountain itself, linked the
cities together, and a postal system extended over
the empire composed of relays of couriers who
wore a peculiar livery and ran from one post to
another at the rate of one hundred and fifty miles
a day. The walls of temples and palaces were
covered with plates of gold encrusted with precious
stones. The raiment of the king and nobles
was embroidered with jewels. The lakes in the
royal court-yards were fringed with wild flowers
brought from every corner of the empire and
representing every degree of climate. In a word,
it was the dream of El Dorado fulfilled.</p>

<p>Although these two countries were alike
peopled by races who had lived there since remote
antiquity, neither had ever heard of the
existence of the other, and thus we have the
picture of two civilizations, very similar, springing
up independently.</p>

<p>The conquest of Mexico by Cortez in 1521
changed the entire life of the people. Their
forts and cities were ruined; three of their kings
had fallen during the struggle; the whole country
had been divided among the conquerors, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span>
Aztecs were made slaves. Cortez rebuilt the
City of Mexico and filled the country with
cathedrals and convents. He tried to convert
the natives to Christianity, and Mexico became
Spanish in its laws and institutions.</p>

<p>But the old civilization had passed away; there
was no more an Aztec nation; and though in
time the Indians and Spaniards formed together
a new race, it did not partake of the spirit of the
old.</p>

<p>What Cortez did for Mexico, Pizarro accomplished
twelve years later in Peru. On the death
of their monarch, the Inca, the Peruvians lost
spirit and were more easily conquered than the
Aztecs. Peru became a Spanish province, and,
like Mexico, was considered by the crown only
as a treasure-house from which to draw endless
wealth. No regret was felt for the two great
and powerful nations that had ceased to exist.</p>

<p>In the meantime the settlement of America
went on rapidly. Florida, the valley of the
Mississippi, Canada, and New England became
powerful colonies forming the nucleus of new
countries, which had never heard of the civilizations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span>
of Mexico and Peru, and whose only knowledge
of Indians was gathered from the savage
tribes from which they had wrested the soil. In
1610 the Spanish historian Solis wrote an account
of the subjugation of Mexico, in which
the conquerors were portrayed in glowing colors.
This work was read chiefly by scholars. In
1779 the English historian Robertson gave in
his <i>History of the New World</i> a brilliant sketch
of the Spanish conquests in America. But not
until 1847 was the world offered the detailed
narrative of the conquest and ruin of the Aztec
empire.</p>

<p>This work was from the pen of the American
scholar, William H. Prescott, who was already
known as the author of a history of Ferdinand
and Isabella of Spain, a work which had brought
him a European reputation.</p>

<p>Prescott was born in Salem, Mass., in 1796,
in an old elm-shaded house. From his earliest
years he was a teller of stories, and had a high
reputation among his boy friends as a romancer.
Walking to and from school with his companions
he invented tale after tale, sometimes the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span>
narrative being continued from day to day,
lessons and home duties being considered but
tiresome interruptions to the real business of life.
Very often one of these stories begun on Monday
would be continued through the whole week,
and the end be celebrated on Saturday by a visit
to the Boston Athen&#230;um, into whose recesses
he would beguile his fellows, while they buckled
on the old armor found there, and played at
joust and tournament, imagining themselves to
be Lancelot, Ronsard, or Bayard, as the case
might be.</p>

<p>A life of Gibbon which Prescott read in his
teens led to an enthusiastic study of history and
to the resolve to become if possible a historian
himself. While a student at Harvard one of his
eyes was so injured by the carelessness of a
fellow pupil that he lost the entire use of it; but
he kept to the resolution to fulfil the task he had
set for himself. His fame began with the publication
of the <i>History of Ferdinand and Isabella</i>,
which was published almost simultaneously
in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, and Russia.
It covers the history of Spain from the Moorish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg 90]</span>
invasion through the period of national glory
which illumined the reign of Isabella. The
civil wars, the Jewish persecutions, the discovery
of the New World, the expulsion of the Moors,
the Italian wars, and the social life of the people,
their arts and pursuits, their amusements, and
the literature of that age, are vividly presented.</p>

<p>The recognition of his merits was welcome to
Prescott. While doubting which subject to
choose for his labors he had heard several lectures
upon Spanish literature, prepared for delivery
at Harvard College, and at once applied
himself to the study of the Spanish language,
history, and romance as a preparation for his
life work, and two years after began his celebrated
work. The book was eleven years in preparation,
and is full of enthusiasm for the romance
and chivalry of the Old World. Prescott's
<i>History of the Conquest of Mexico</i> began
with a sketch of the ancient Aztec civilization,
proceeded to a description of the conquest by
Cortez, and concluded with an account of the
after career of the great commander, the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg 91]</span>
work seeming a brilliant romance rather than
sober history.</p>

<p>The materials for Prescott's work were gathered
from every known available source. The
narratives of eye-witnesses were brought forth
from their hiding-places in the royal libraries of
Spain, and patiently transcribed; old letters, unpublished
chronicles, royal edicts, monkish legends,
every scrap of information attainable, was
transmitted to the worker across the sea, who
because of his partial blindness had to depend
entirely upon others in the collection of his authorities.
These documents were read to Prescott
by a secretary, who took notes under the
author's direction; these notes were again read
to him, and then after sifting, comparing and,
retracing again and again the old ground, the
historian began his work. He wrote upon a
noctograph with an ivory stylus, as a blind man
writes, and because of great physical weakness
he was able to accomplish only a very little each
day. But week by week the work grew. His
marvellous memory enabled him to recall sixty
pages of printed matter at once. His wonderful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg 92]</span>
imagination enabled him to present the Mexico
of the sixteenth century as it appeared to the old
Spanish cavaliers, and as no historian had ever
presented it before. He made of each episode
of the great drama a finished and perfect picture.
In fact, the <i>History of the Conquest of Mexico</i>
is more than anything else a historical painting
wrought to perfection by the cunning of the
master hand.</p>

<p>Prescott spent six years over this work, which
enhanced his fame as a historian and kept for
American literature the high place won by Irving.
Indeed, Irving himself had designed to
write the history of the conquest of Mexico, but
withdrew in favor of Prescott.</p>

<p>Three months after the publication of his work
on Mexico, Prescott began the <i>History of the
Conquest of Peru</i>, the materials for which had
already been obtained. But these documents
proved much more complete than those describing
the Mexican conquest.</p>

<p>The conquest of Mexico was achieved mainly
by one man, Cortez; but while Pizarro was virtually
the head of the expedition against Peru,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg 93]</span>
he was accompanied by others whose plans were
often opposed to his own, and whose personal
devotion could never be counted upon. Each of
these men held regular correspondence with the
court of Spain, and Pizarro never knew when
his own account of the capture of a city or settlement
of a colony would be contradicted by the
statement of one of his officers. After the capture
and death of the Inca, which was the real
conquest of the country from the natives, Pizarro
was obliged to reconquer Peru from his
own officers, who quarrelled with him and
among themselves continually.</p>

<p>The conquest is shown to be a war of adventurers,
a crusade of buccaneers, who wanted
only gold. The sieges and battles of the Spaniards
read like massacres, and the story of the
death of the Inca like an unbelievable horror
of the Dark Ages. This scene, contrasted with
the glowing description of the former magnificence
of the Inca, shows Prescott in his most
brilliant mood as a writer. Perhaps his greatest
gift is this power of reproducing faithfully
the actual spirit of the conquest, a spirit which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg 94]</span>
in spite of the glitter of arms and splendor of
religious ceremonial, proves to have been one of
greed and lowest selfishness.</p>

<p><i>The Conquest of Peru</i>, published in 1847, when
Prescott was fifty-two years old, was the last of his
historical works. These three histories, with three
volumes of an uncompleted life of Philip II.,
which promised to be his greatest work, and a
volume of essays comprise Prescott's contribution
to American literature, and begin that series
of brilliant historical works of which American
letters boast.</p>

<p>Prescott, during the most of his literary life,
was obliged to sit quietly in his study, leaving to
other hands the collection of the materials for his
work. For, besides the accident which during
his college life deprived him of one eye, he was
always delicate. Sometimes he would be kept
for months in a darkened room, and at best his
life was one of seclusion. The strife of the
world and of action was not for him. In his
library, surrounded by his books and assisted by
his secretary, he sought for truth as the old alchemists
sought for gold. Patient and tireless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span>
he unravelled thread after thread of the fabric
from which he was to weave the history of the
Spanish conquests.</p>

<p>If Prescott had had access to documents which
have since come to light, if he had been able to
visit the places he described, and to study their
unwritten records, his work would have been a
splendid and imperishable monument to the dead
civilization of the Aztec and Peruvian.</p>

<p>As it is, it must serve as a guiding light pointing
to the right way, one which shed lustre on
the new literature of his country and opened an
unexplored region to the American writer.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER</h3>

<h4>1807-1892</h4>


<p>In an old New England farm-house kitchen,
a barefoot boy, dressed in homespun, one day
sat listening to a lazy Scotch beggar who piped
the songs of Burns in return for his meal of
bread and cheese and cider. The beggar was
good-natured, and the boy was an eager listener,
and <i>Bonnie Doon</i>, <i>Highland Mary</i>, and <i>Auld
Lang Syne</i> were trilled forth as the master himself
may have sung them among the Scottish
"banks and braes." Never before had the
farmer boy heard of the famous peasant, and a
new door was opened through which he passed
into an undreamed of world. A few months
later the school-master gave him a copy of
Burns's poems, and with this gift the boy became
a poet himself. For these songs of roadsides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg 97]</span>
and meadows, of ploughed fields and wet hedgerows,
were to him familiar pictures of every-day
life, whose poetry, once revealed, had to express
itself in words.</p>

<p>The boy was the son of John and Abigail
Whittier, Quaker farmers owning a little homestead
in the valley of the Merrimac, near the
town of Haverhill, Mass. In honor of an ancestor
he had been named John Greenleaf Whittier,
the Greenleaf, as he tells us in one of his
poems, having become Americanized from the
French <i>feuille verte</i>, <i>green leaf</i>, a suggestion,
perhaps, of far away days in which the family
might have been men of the wood, keepers
of the deer or forest guarders in France during
feudal ages. In his boyhood, life in the
Merrimac valley was primitive enough. The
house was small and plain, the kitchen being the
living room, and the parlor dedicated to Sunday
and holiday use only. The floor was sanded and
on the wide fire-place benches the men and
children of the family sat at night to whittle axe-handles,
mend shoes, crack nuts, or learn the
next day's lessons. Often a stranger was found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg 98]</span>
among them; some Quaker travelling on business,
or a stranger on his way to some distant
town, or perhaps a professional beggar to whom
the hospitality of the place was well known.
Once when the mother had refused a night's
shelter to an unprepossessing vagabond, John
was sent out to bring him back. He proved
to be an Italian artisan, and after supper he
told them of the Italian grape gatherings and
festivals, and of the wonderful beauty of Italy,
paying for his entertainment by presenting to
the mother a recipe for making bread from
chestnuts.</p>

<p>Sometimes the visitor would be an uncanny
old crone who still believed in witches and
fairies, and who told how her butter refused to
come, or how her candle had been snuffed out
by a witch in the form of a big black bug. One
old woman in the neighborhood was renowned
for her tales of ghosts, devils, fairies, brownies,
sprenties, enchanted towers, headless men,
haunted mills that were run at night by ghostly
millers and witches riding on broom-sticks by
the light of the full moon, and descending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg 99]</span>
unguarded chimneys to lay their spells upon cream-pot
and yeast-bowl.</p>

<p>After such an evening's entertainment the
boy needed courage to leave the bright kitchen
fire and climb up the narrow stairs to the loft
where he slept, and where the sound of the
night-wind crept through the frosty rafters, and
the voice of the screech-owl came dismally from
the trees outside.</p>

<p>Haverhill boasted at that time its village conjurer,
who could remove the spells of those
wicked spirits, and whose gaunt form could be
seen any day along the meadows and streams
gathering herbs to be stewed and brewed into
love-potions, cures for melancholy, spells against
witchcraft, and other remedies for human ills.
He was held in great respect by the inhabitants,
and feared almost as much as the witches themselves.</p>

<p>An ever-welcome guest at the Whittiers was
the school-master, whose head was full of the
local legends, and whose tales of Indian raids
and of revolutionary struggles were regarded as
authentic history. This Yankee pedagogue,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span>
moreover, could, with infinite spirit and zest, retell
the classic stories of the Greek and Latin
poets.</p>

<p>Twice a year came to the little homestead the
Yankee pedler, with his supply of pins, needles,
thread, razors, soaps, and scissors for the elders,
and jack-knives for the boys who had been saving
their pennies to purchase those treasures. He
had gay ribbons for worldly minded maids, but
these were never bought for Quaker Whittier's
daughters. But to Poet John's thinking the
pedler's choicest wares were the songs of his own
composing, printed with wood-cuts, which he
sold at an astonishingly low price, or even, upon
occasions, gave away. These songs celebrated
earthquakes, fires, shipwrecks, hangings, marriages,
deaths, and funerals. Often they were
improvised as the pedler sat with the rest around
the hearth fire. If a wedding had occurred
during his absence he was ready to versify it,
and equally ready to lament the loss of a favorite
cow. To Whittier this gift of rhyming
seemed marvellous, and in after years he described
this wandering minstrel as encircled, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span>
his young eyes, with the very nimbus of immortality.</p>

<p>Such was the home-life of this barefooted boy,
who drove the cows night and morning through
the dewy meadows, and followed the oxen, breaking
the earth into rich brown furrows, whose sight
and smell suggested to him always the generous
bounty of nature. From early spring, when the
corn was planted in fields bordered by wild rose-bushes,
to late autumn, when the crop lay bound
into glistening sheaves, his life was one of steady
toil, lightened sometimes by a day's fishing in the
mountain streams or by a berrying excursion up
among the hills.</p>

<p>In cold weather he went to school in the little
school-house that he celebrates in one of his
poems, and very often, as he confessed, he was
found writing verses instead of doing sums on
his slate.</p>

<p>This old phase of New-England life has now
passed away, but he has preserved its memory in
three poems, which are in a special sense biographical.
These poems are, <i>The Barefoot Boy</i>,
<i>My Schoolmaster</i>, and <i>Snow-Bound</i>. The first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span>
two are simple, boyish memories, but the last is a
description not only of his early home, but of the
New-England farm life, and is a Puritan idyl.</p>

<p>All are full of the idealization of childhood,
for the poet could never break loose from the
charm which had enthralled him as a boy. The
poetry of common life which lay over the meadow
lands and fields of grain, which gave a voice to
the woodland brook, and glorified the falling
rain and snow, was felt by Whittier, when, as a
child, he paused from his work to listen to the
robin's song among the wheat or watch the flocks
of clouds making their way across the summer
sky.</p>

<p>When he was nineteen years of age the country-side
mail-carrier one day rode up to the farm
and took from his saddle-bags the weekly paper,
which he tossed to the boy, who stood mending
a fence. With trembling eagerness Whittier
opened it, and saw in the "Poet's Corner" his
first printed poem. He had sent it with little
hope that it would be accepted, and the sight of
it filled him with joy, and determined his literary
career. A few months later the editor of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg 103]</span>
paper, William Lloyd Garrison, drove out to
the homestead to see the young verse-maker.
Whittier was called from the field where he was
hoeing, and in the interview that followed Garrison
insisted that such talent should not be
thrown away, and urged the youth to take a
course of study at some academy. But, although
the farm supplied the daily needs of the family,
money was scarce, and the sum required for
board and tuition was impossible to scrape together.
A young farm assistant, however, offered
to teach Whittier the trade of shoemaking, and
his every moment of leisure was thereafter spent
in learning this craft. During the following
winter the lad furnished the women of the neighborhood
with good, well-made shoes, and with
the money thus earned he entered Haverhill
Academy in April, 1827, being then in his twentieth
year. For the next six months his favorite
haunts in field and wood were unvisited, except
on the Saturdays and Sundays spent with his
family. He gained some reputation as a poet
by the publication of the ode which he wrote
in honor of the new academy, and although he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg 104]</span>
returned to the farm after six months of study,
it was only to earn more money for further
schooling.</p>

<p>His poems and sketches now began to appear
in the different newspapers and periodicals,
and he did some editing for various papers.
This work brought him into notice among literary
people, but it was his political convictions
that first gave him a national reputation.</p>

<p>From the first Whittier stood side by side with
William Lloyd Garrison in his crusade against
slavery, and many of his best poems appeared in
the <i>Liberator</i>, Garrison's own paper. These
poems, with others, were collected in a volume
called <i>Voices of Freedom</i>. It was these songs,
which rushed onward like his own mountain
brooks, that made Whittier known from one
end of the country to the other as an apostle of
liberty. All Whittier's poems of this period belong
to the political history of the country, of
which they are as much a part as the war records.</p>

<p>In all this work there is no trace of bitterness
or enmity. His songs of freedom were but the
bugle-notes calling the nation to a higher humanity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span>
Like the old Hebrew prophets, he spared
not his own, and many of his most burning words
are a summons to duty to his brothers in the
North. If he could remind the South that the
breath of slavery tainted the air</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"That old Dekalb and Sumter drank,"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>he could also, in <i>Barbara Frietchie</i>, pay loving
tribute to the noble heart of one of her best-loved
sons. His was the dream of the great nation to
be&mdash;his spirit that of the preacher who saw his
people unfaithful to the high trust they had received
as guardians of the land which the world
had been taught to regard as the home of liberty.
It was this high conception that gave to his work
its greatest power, and that made Whittier,
above all others, the poet of freedom; so that
although the mission of these poems has ceased,
and as literature they will not appeal to succeeding
generations as forcibly as they did to their
own, as a part of national history they will be
long preserved.</p>

<p>Whittier's other poems deal so largely with the
home-life of his day that he is called the poet of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span>
New England. All its traditions, memories, and
beliefs are faithfully recorded by him. In <i>Snow-Bound</i>
we have the life of the New-England
farmer. In <i>Mabel Martin</i> we see again the old
Puritan dogmatism hunting down witches, burning
or hanging them, and following with relentless
persecution the families of the unhappy
wretches who thus came under the ban. In <i>Mogg
Megone</i> is celebrated in beautiful verse one of
those legends of Indian life which linger immortally
around the pines of New England, while
the <i>Grave by the Lake</i>, the <i>Changeling</i>, the
<i>Wreck of Rivermouth</i>, the <i>Dead Ship of Harpswell</i>,
and others in the collection called the <i>Tent
on the Beach</i>, revive old traditions of those early
days when history mingled with legend and the
belief in water-spirits and ghostly warnings had
not yet vanished.</p>

<p>In some exquisite ballads, such as <i>School Days</i>,
we have the memory of the past, fresh as the
wild violets which the poet culled as a boy, while
<i>Maud Muller</i> is a very idyl of a New-England
harvest-field in the poet's youth. In <i>Among the
Hills</i> we have some of Whittier's best poems of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span>
country life, while many minor poems celebrate
the hills and streams of which he was so fond.
Whittier wrote, also, many beautiful hymns, and
his poems for children, such as <i>King Solomon
and the Ants</i> and <i>The Robin</i>, show how easy it
was for his great heart to enter into the spirit of
childhood. <i>Child Life</i>, his compilation of poems
for childhood, is one of the best ever made,
while another compilation, called <i>Songs of Three
Centuries</i>, shows his wide familiarity and appreciation
of all that is great in English poetry.</p>

<p>After the sale of the old home of his childhood
Whittier lived in the house at Amesbury,
which for many years his sister shared. His last
collection of poems, called <i>Sundown</i>, was published
in 1890, for some friends only, as a memento
of his eightieth birthday. He died two
years later, and was buried in the yard of the
Friends' meeting-house in Amesbury, a short
distance from his birthplace.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE</h3>

<h4>1804-1864</h4>


<p>In 1804 the town of Salem, in Massachusetts,
was the most important seaport in America.
With the regularity of the tides its ships sailed to
China, the East Indies, the Feejee Islands, South
America, and the West Indies, and its seamen
were as well known in the harbors of these distant
places as in their native town. Throughout
the Revolution Salem, with some neighboring
smaller ports, was the hope of the colonists.
No American navy existed; but the merchants
and marines turned their vessels into ships of
war, and under the name of privateers swept the
seas of British cruisers, capturing in six years
over four hundred and fifty prizes. During the
war of 1812, again, the naval service was led by
the hardy Salem captains, and the brave little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg 109]</span>
seaport gave generously to the cause of the
nation. Salem from the first was identified with
American independence. Upon her hillsides
one memorable day the inhabitants gathered to
watch the fight between the Chesapeake and the
Shannon, and through her streets, a few weeks
later, the body of the heroic Lawrence was
borne in state. Among the thronging crowds
that day must have wandered the boy Nathaniel
Hawthorne, then in his tenth year. Born in
Salem, he came of a line of seafaring men who
had fought their way to fame and fortune in the
teeth of wind and wave; his family having its
American beginning at the time when Indian
and white man alike made their homes in the
shadowy aisles of the New-England forests.
These ocean-roving ancestors were among the
first to take an American ship to St. Petersburg,
Sumatra, Australia, and Africa. They fought
pirates, overcame savages, suffered shipwreck
and disaster, and many of them found their
graves in the waters of some foreign sea. Hawthorne's
own father was lost on a voyage.</p>

<p>From this race of hardy sailors Hawthorne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg 110]</span>
inherited the patience, courage, and endurance
which were the basis of his character, a character
touched besides by that melancholy and love of
solitude which is apt to distinguish those born
by the sea. It is this combination, perhaps, of
Puritan steadfastness of purpose and wild adventurous
life that descended to Hawthorne in the
form of the most exquisite imagination tinctured
with the highest moral aspirations. It was the
sturdy, healthy plant of Puritanism blossoming
into a beautiful flower.</p>

<p>In this old town of Salem, with its quaint
houses, with their carved doorways and many
windows, with its pretty rose-gardens, its beautiful
overshadowing elms, its dingy court-house and
celebrated town-pump, Hawthorne passed his
early life, his picturesque surroundings forming
a suitable environment for the handsome, imaginative
boy who was to create the most beautiful
literary art that America had yet known. Behind
the town stood old Witch Hill, grim and
ghastly with memories of the witches hanged
there in colonial times. In front spread the sea,
a golden argosy of promise, whose wharves and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span>
warehouses held priceless stores of merchandise.
Between this haunting spirit of the past and the
broader, newer life of the future, Hawthorne
walked with the serene hope of the youth of
that day. The old, intolerant Puritanism had
passed away. Only the fine gold remained as
the priceless treasure of the new generation.</p>

<p>Hawthorne's boyhood was much like that of
any other boy in Salem town. He went to
school and to church, loved the sea and prophesied
that he should go away on it some day and
never return, was fond of reading, and ready to
fight with any school-fellows who had, as he expressed
it, "a quarrelsome disposition." He was
a healthy, robust lad, finding life a good thing
whether he was roaming the streets, sitting idly
on the wharves, or stretched on the floor at
home reading a favorite author.</p>

<p>Almost all boys who have become writers
have liked the same books, and Hawthorne,
like his fellows, lived in the magic world of
Shakespeare and Milton, Spenser, Froissart,
and Bunyan. <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i> was an
especial favorite with him, its lofty spirit carrying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg 112]</span>
his soul into those spiritual regions which
the child mind reverences without understanding.
For one year of his boyhood he was supremely
happy in the wild regions of Sebago
Lake, Me., where the family lived for a time.
Here, he says, he led the life of a bird of the
air, with no restraint and in absolute freedom.
In the summer he would take his gun and spend
days in the forest, doing whatever pleased his
vagabond spirit at the moment. In the winter
he would follow the hunters through the snow,
or skate till midnight alone upon the frozen lake
with only the shadows of the hills to keep him
company, and sometimes pass the remainder of
the night in a solitary log cabin, warmed by the
blaze of the fallen evergreens.</p>

<p>But he had to return to Salem to prepare for
college, whither he went in 1821, in his seventeenth
year. He entered Bowdoin, and had
among his fellow-students Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow, and Franklin Pierce, afterward
President of the United States. Here Hawthorne
spent happy days, and long afterward,
in writing to an old college friend, he speaks of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg 113]</span>
the charm that lingers around the memory of
the place when he gathered blueberries in study
hours, watched the great logs drifting down the
current of the Androscoggin from the lumber
districts above, fished in the forest streams, and
shot pigeons and squirrels in hours which should
have been devoted to the classics.</p>

<p>In this same letter, which forms the dedication
to one of his books, he adds that it is this friend,
if any one, who is responsible for his becoming
a writer, as it was here, in the shadow of the tall
pines which sheltered Bowdoin College, that the
first prophecy concerning his destiny was made.
He was to be a writer of fiction, the friend said,
little dreaming of the honors that were to crown
one of the great novelists of the world.</p>

<p>After leaving Bowdoin Hawthorne returned
to Salem, where he passed the next twelve years
of his life. Here he produced, from time to
time, stories and sketches which found their
way to the periodicals and won for him a narrow
reputation. But the years which a man
usually devotes to his best work were spent
by Hawthorne in a contented half-dream of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg 114]</span>
great future, for good as is some of the work
produced at this time, it never would have won
for the author the highest place in American
literature. These stories and sketches were
afterward collected and published under the
title <i>Twice-Told Tales</i> and <i>The Snow Image</i>.
Full of the grace and beauty of Hawthorne's
style, they were the best imaginative work yet
produced in America, but in speaking of them
Hawthorne himself says that in this result of
twelve years there is little to show for its thought
and industry.</p>

<p>But the promise of his genius was fulfilled at
last. In 1850, when Hawthorne was forty-six
years old, appeared his first great romance.
Hawthorne had chosen for his subject a picture
of Puritan times in New England, and out of the
tarnished records of the past he created a work
of art of marvellous and imperishable beauty.
In the days of which he wrote, a Puritan town
was exactly like a large family bound together
by mutual interests, the acts of each life being
regarded as affecting the whole community.
Hawthorne has preserved this spirit of colonial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg 115]</span>
New England, with all its struggles, hopes, and
fears, and the conscience-driven Puritan, who
lived in the new generation only in public records
and church histories, was given new life.
In Hawthorne's day this grim figure, stalking in
the midst of Indian fights, village pillories, town-meetings,
witch-burnings, and church-councils
was already a memory. With his steeple-crowned
hat and his matchlock at his side he had
left the pleasant New-England farm lands and
was found only in the court-houses, where his
deeds were recorded. Hawthorne brought him
back from the past, set him in the midst of his
fellow-elders in the church, and showed him a
sufferer for conscience' sake.</p>

<p>This first romance, published under the title
<i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, revealed to Hawthorne himself,
as well as to the world outside, the transcendent
power of his genius. Hawthorne, who
was despondent of the little popularity of his
other books, told the publisher who saw the first
sketch of <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, that he did not
know whether the story was very good or very
bad. The publisher, however, at once perceived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg 116]</span>
its worth and brought it out one year from that
time, and the public saw that it had been entertaining
a genius unawares. Hawthorne's next
book, <i>The House of the Seven Gables</i>, is a story
of the New England of his own day. A clever
critic has called it an impression of a summer
afternoon in an elm-shadowed New-England
town. Through its pages flit quaint contrasting
figures that one might find in New England
and nowhere else. The old spinster of ancient
family, obliged to open a toy and gingerbread
shop, but never forgetting the time when the
house with seven gables was a mansion of limitless
hospitality, is a pathetic picture of disappointed
hope and broken-down fortune. So is
her brother, who was falsely imprisoned for
twenty years, and who in his old age must lean
upon his sister for support; and the other characters
are equally true to the life that has almost
disappeared in the changes of the half-century
since its scenes were made the inspiration of
Hawthorne's romance.</p>

<p><i>The House of the Seven Gables</i> was followed
by two beautiful volumes for children, <i>The Wonder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg 117]</span>
Book</i> and <i>Tanglewood Tales</i>. In <i>The Wonder
Book</i> Hawthorne writes as if he were a child
himself, so simple is the charm that he weaves
around these old, old tales. Not content with
the Greek myths, he created little incidents and
impossible characters that glance in and out with
elfin grace. One feels that these were the very
stories that were told by the centaurs, fauns, and
satyrs themselves in the shadows of the old
Attic forests. Here we learn that King Midas
not only had his palace turned to gold, but that
his own little daughter, Marigold, a fancy of
Hawthorne's own, was also converted into the
same shining metal. We learn, too, the secrets
of many a hero and god of this realm of fancy
which had been unsuspected by any other historian
of their deeds. Every child who reads <i>The
Wonder Book</i> doubts not that Hawthorne had
hobnobbed many a moonlit night with Pan and
Bacchus in their vine-covered grottos by the
riverside. This dainty, ethereal touch appears
in all his work for children.</p>

<p>A like quality gives distinction to his fourth
great novel, which deals with a man supposed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg 118]</span>
be a descendant of the old fauns. This creation,
named Donatello, from his resemblance to the
celebrated statue of the Marble Faun, is not
wholly human, although he has human interests
and feeling. Hawthorne makes Donatello
ashamed of his pointed ears, though his spirit is
as wild and untamed as that of his rude ancestors.
In this book there is a description of a
scene where Count Donatello joins in a peasant
dance around a public fountain. And so vividly
is his half-human nature here brought out that
Hawthorne seems to have witnessed somewhere
the mad revels of the veritable fauns and satyrs
in the days of their life upon the earth.
Throughout this story Hawthorne shows the
same subtle sympathy with uncommon natures,
the mystery of such souls having the same
fascination for him that the secrets of the
earth and air have for the scientist and philosopher.</p>

<p>The book coming between <i>The House of
the Seven Gables</i> and <i>The Marble Faun</i> is
called <i>The Blithedale Romance</i>. It is in part
the record of a period of Hawthorne's life when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg 119]</span>
he joined a community which hoped to improve
the world by combining healthy manual labor
with intellectual pursuits, and proving that self-interest
and all differences in rank must be hurtful
to the commonwealth. This little society
lived in a suburb of Boston, and called their
association Brook Farm. Each member performed
daily some manual labor on the farm or
in the house, hours being set aside for study.
Here Hawthorne ploughed the fields and joined
in the amusements, or sat apart while the rest
talked about art and literature, danced, sang, or
read Shakespeare aloud. Some of the cleverest
men and women of New England joined this
community, the rules of which obliged the men
to wear plaid blouses and rough straw hats, and
the women to content themselves with plain
calico gowns.</p>

<p>These serious-minded men and women, who
tried to solve a great problem by leading the
lives of Arcadian shepherds, at length dispersed,
each one going back to the world and working
on as bravely as if the experiment had been a
great success. The experiences of Brook Farm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span>
were shadowed forth in <i>The Blithedale Romance</i>,
although it was not a literal narrative.</p>

<p>Immediately after this Hawthorne was married
and went to live in Concord, near Boston, in a
quaint old dwelling called The Manse. And as
all his work partakes of the personal flavor of his
own life, so his existence here is recorded in a
delightful series of essays called <i>Mosses from an
Old Manse</i>. Here we have a description of the
old house itself, and of the author's family life,
of the kitchen-garden and apple-orchards, of the
meadows and woods, and of his friendship with
that lover of nature, Henry Thoreau, whose writings
form a valuable contribution to American
literature. The <i>Mosses from an Old Manse</i>
must ever be famous as the history of the quiet
hours of one of the greatest American men of
letters. They are full of Hawthorne's own personality,
and reveal more than any other of his
books the depth and purity of his poetic and
rarely gifted nature.</p>

<p>In 1853 his old friend and schoolmate, President
Pierce, appointed Hawthorne American
Consul at Liverpool. He remained abroad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg 121]</span>
seven years, spending the last four on the Continent,
some transcriptions of his experience being
found in the celebrated <i>Marble Faun</i> and
in several volumes of <i>Note-Books</i>. <i>The Marble
Faun</i>, published in Europe under the title <i>Transformation</i>,
was written in Rome, and was partly
suggested to Hawthorne by an old villa which
he occupied near Florence. This old villa possessed
a moss-covered tower, "haunted," as
Hawthorne said in a letter to a friend, "by owls
and by the ghost of a monk who was confined
there in the thirteenth century previous to being
burnt at the stake in the principal square in
Florence." He also states in the same letter
that he meant to put the old castle bodily in a
romance that was then in his head, which he
did by making the villa the old family castle of
Donatello, although the scene of the story is laid
in Rome.</p>

<p>After Hawthorne's return to America he
began two other novels, one founded upon the
old legend of the elixir of life. This story was
probably suggested to him by Thoreau, who
spoke of a house in which Hawthorne once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg 122]</span>
lived at Concord having been, a century or two
before, the abode of a man who believed that he
should never die. This subject was a charming
one for Hawthorne's peculiar genius, but the
story, with another, <i>The Dolliver Romance</i>, was
interrupted by the death of Hawthorne in 1864.</p>

<p>In point of literary art the romances of Hawthorne
are the finest work yet done in America,
and their author was a man of high imagination,
lofty morality, and pure ideals; an artist in the
noblest meaning of the word.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>GEORGE BANCROFT</h3>

<h4>1800-1891</h4>


<p>Seventy years ago the Round Hill School at
Northampton, Mass., was perhaps the most
famous school in New England. The founder,
George Bancroft, had modelled it upon a celebrated
school in Switzerland, in the hope that it
would prove a starting-point for a broader system
of elementary training than had yet existed
in America, and everything was done to develop
the physical and moral, as well as the mental,
traits of the pupils. The school was beautifully
situated, commanding a superb view, and had,
besides the school-rooms, a gymnasium and play-rooms
that were kept warm in cold weather and
furnished with tools for carpentering. Here the
boys could make bows and arrows, squirrel-traps,
kites, sleds, and whatever their fancy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg 124]</span>
dictated. There were large play-grounds on the
slopes of the hill, and here was the village of
"Cronyville," every house, hut, or shanty in
which had been built and was owned by the
boys themselves. There were many varieties of
architecture in "Cronyville," but each dwelling
had at least a large chimney and a small store-room.
After school hours each shanty was its
owner's castle, where entertainments were held,
and the guests feasted with roasted corn, nuts,
or apples, which the entire company had helped
to prepare on the hearth of the wide chimney.
Sometimes the feast was enlivened by recitations,
poems, and addresses by the pupils, among
whom was at one time the future historian,
John Lothrop Motley, and very often the festivities
would end in one of those earnest talks that
boys fall into sometimes when tired out with
play. Bancroft's assistant and partner in the
school was Dr. Cogswell, who superintended the
course of study, which was carried out by the
best teachers procurable in America, England,
and France. The boys were in the main good
students, some of them brilliant ones, and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg 125]</span>
enjoyed so much freedom that their spirits
gained them sometimes an unenviable reputation.
The solemn keeper of a certain inn on the
stage line between Northampton and Boston
suffered so much from their pranks that he refused
to allow them to stop over night, and only
consented to give them dinner upon promise of
good behavior.</p>

<p>The school became so popular that the best
families in all parts of the country sent their
boys there, but, financially, it was not a success,
and after seven years' trial Bancroft was forced
to abandon it, though his partner struggled on a
few years longer. If the experiment had been
entirely successful the cause of education might
have been advanced fifty years ahead of the old
method, for both founders were men devoted to
the cause of education and longed to see newer
and broader methods supersede the old ones.</p>

<p>As a boy Bancroft had studied at the Exeter
Academy; finishing his course there he entered
Harvard at thirteen, was graduated in his seventeenth
year, and a year later was sent abroad by
Harvard to fit himself for a tutorship in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg 126]</span>
University. During his four years' absence he
studied modern languages and literatures, Greek
philosophy and antiquities, and some natural history.
But he made history the special object of
study, and bent all his energies to acquiring as
wide a knowledge as possible of the sources and
materials that make up the records of modern
history. During his vacations he visited the
different countries of Europe, travelling in regular
student fashion. He would rise at dawn,
breakfast by candlelight, and then fill the morning
with visits to picture galleries, cathedrals, and
all the wonders of foreign towns; after a light
luncheon he would start again on his sight-seeing,
or visit some person of note, meeting
during his travels almost every distinguished
man in Europe. At night, if not too tired, he
would study still politics, languages, and history,
and when he returned to America he had made
such good use of his time that he was equipped
for almost any position in its intellectual life.</p>

<p>His obligations to Harvard led him to accept
a tutorship there, which, however, proved so distasteful
to him that he only held it one year. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg 127]</span>
was after this experience that he founded his
school at Round Hill. During the years that
he was trying to make the Round Hill school a
model for boys' schools, the idea of his work as
the historian of the United States came to him.
Undismayed by the scope of the work, which he
meant should include the history of the United
States from the time of the landing of Columbus
to the adoption of the Constitution in 1789,
Bancroft, month after month, settled the plan
more definitely in his mind; and when the time
came for him to begin the work he only looked
forward eagerly to the task of writing the records
of three hundred years of the world's progress
during the most absorbing period known to history.
It is doubtful if at this time there was
any other man living better qualified for this
task than Bancroft. He had been a student of
history and politics since boyhood. He had
traced the stream of history from its sources in
the East through the rise of the great modern
nations. He had mastered the politics of the
ancient world, whose language, literature, and
art were also familiar to him, and civilized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg 128]</span>
Europe had been his field of study during the
years which leave the most profound impressions
upon the mind.</p>

<p>To him the rise and establishment of the
United States as a great nation presented itself
as one of the most brilliant passages of
the world's history, and no labor seemed tiresome
which should fittingly chronicle that event.</p>

<p>Besides his literary requirements Bancroft
possessed eminent qualities for practical life.
He was successively Governor of Massachusetts,
Secretary of the Navy, and for a time Acting-Secretary
of war; he served his country as
Minister to Great Britain. He was made Minister
to Prussia and afterward Minister to Germany
when that country took its place as a
united nation. Some of the most important
treaties between the United States and foreign
powers were made during Bancroft's diplomatic
career, and in every act of his political life
showed a talent for practical affairs. While
he was Secretary of the Navy he founded the
United States Naval Academy at Annapolis.
Previous to this there was no good system by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg 129]</span>
which the boys who desired to enter the navy
could receive instruction in any other branch
than that of practical seamanship. In the old
navy the middies were taught, while afloat, by
the chaplains, who gave them lessons in odd
hours in writing, arithmetic, and navigation; if
the pupils were idle they were reported to the
captain, whose discipline was far from gentle.
A boy eager to learn could pick up a great deal
by asking questions and noticing what was going
on about him, and sometimes the officers would
volunteer their help in a difficult subject. Later
each ship had one regular school-master, who
made the voyage with the ship, twenty middies
being appointed to each man-of-war. This system
was superseded by schools, which were
established at the different navy-yards, and
which the boys attended in the intervals of sea
duty; but, as in the case of the other methods,
the instruction was desultory, and the pupils had
not the advantage of education enjoyed by the
cadets of the West Point Military Academy,
though it was evident the necessity for it was
the same.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg 130]</span>

<p>Bancroft brought to the office of Secretary of
the Navy his old love for broad principles of
education, and eight months after he took office
the United States Naval Academy was in
full operation, with a corps of instructors of the
first merit, and with a complement of pupils
that spoke well for the national interest in the
cause. At first the course was for five years,
the first and last of which only were spent at
the Academy and the rest at sea, but this
was later modified to its present form. Bancroft's
generous policy placed the new institution
upon a firm basis, and it became at once a
vital force in the life of the United States Navy.</p>

<p>Bancroft began his history while still at Round
Hill, and published the first volume in 1834.
Previous to beginning his history he had published
a small volume of verse, a Latin Reader,
and a book on Greek politics for the use of the
Round Hill School, and various translations
and miscellaneous writings in the different periodicals
of the day. But none of these had
seemed serious work to him, and he brought
to his history a mind fresh to literary labor, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg 131]</span>
a fund of general information that was invaluable.</p>

<p>While he was minister to Great Britain he
visited the state archives of England, France,
and Germany for additional historical material.
From this time he devoted himself as exclusively
to his work as the diplomatic positions
he held would allow.</p>

<p>His official administration in his own country
was also far-reaching. Besides the establishment
of the Naval Academy, it was he who,
while acting as Secretary of War <i>pro tem.</i>, gave
the famous order for General Taylor to move
forward to the western boundary of Texas,
which had been annexed to the United States
after seceding from Mexico and setting up as
a republic. General Taylor's appearance on
the borders was the signal to Mexico that the
United States intended to defend the new territory,
and eventually led to the war with Mexico,
by which the <a name="United" id="United"></a>United States received the
territory of New Mexico and California.</p>

<p>When the lookout on the Pinta called out
"Land ho!" he really uttered the first word of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span>
American history, and Bancroft's narrative begins
almost at this point. The first volume embraces
the early French and Spanish voyages; the settlement
of the Colonies; descriptions of colonial
life in New England and Virginia; the fall and
restoration of the house of Stuart in England,
which led to such important results in American
history, and Bacon's Rebellion in Virginia,
which was the first note of warning to England
that the American Colonies would not tolerate
English injustice without a protest. To the
reader who loves to find in history facts more
marvellous than any imaginations of fairy lore,
the first volume of Bancroft's history must ever
be a region of delight. The picturesque figure
of Columbus fronting undismayed the terrors of
that unknown sea, which the geographers of the
period peopled with demons and monsters; the
adventures of the French and Spanish courtiers
in search of fabled rivers and life-giving fountains;
the trials of the gold-seekers, De Soto,
Navarez, Cabe&#231;a de Vaca, and others, who sought
for the riches of the romantic East; and the
heroic suffering of those innumerable bands who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg 133]</span>
first looked upon the wonders of the New World,
and opened the way to its great career, are such
stories as are found in the sober history of no
other country. To the Old World, whose beginnings
of history were lost in the mists of the
past, this vision of the New World, with its beauty
of mountains, river, and forest, with its inexhaustible
wealth and its races yet living in the
primitive conditions of remote antiquity, was
indeed a wonder hardly to be believed. It is
something to be present at the birth of a new
world, and Bancroft has followed the voyagers
and settlers in their own spirit, made their adventures
his own, and given to the reader a
brilliant as well as faithful picture of the historic
beginning of the American continent.</p>

<p>In his second volume Bancroft takes up the
history of the Dutch in America; of the occupations
of the Valley of the Mississippi by the
French; of the expulsion of the French from
Canada by the English, and the minor events
which went toward the accomplishment of these
objects. Here are introduced the romantic story
of Acadia and the picturesque side of Indian life.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg 134]</span>
"The Indian mother places her child, as spring
does its blossoms, upon the boughs of the trees
while she works," says Bancroft in describing
the sleeping-places of the Indian babies, and we
see the same sympathetic touch throughout his
descriptions of these dark children of the forest, to
whom the white man came as a usurper of their
rights and destroyer of their woodland homes.</p>

<p>The remaining volumes of the history consist
almost entirely of the causes which led up to the
American Revolution, the Revolution itself, and
its effect upon Europe. One-half of the whole
work is devoted to this theme, which is treated
with a philosophical breadth that makes it comparable
to the work of the greatest historians.
Here we are led to see that, besides its influence
upon the history of the New World, the American
Revolution was one of the greatest events in
the world's history; that it followed naturally
from the revolt of the Netherlands against Spain
and the Revolution of the English people against
the tyranny of Charles I., and that, like them, its
highest mission was to vindicate the cause of
liberty.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg 135]</span>

<p>In two other volumes, entitled <i>History of
the Formation of the Constitution of the United
States</i>, Bancroft gave a minute and careful
description of the consolidation of the States
into an individual nation after the Revolution,
and the draughting and adopting of the Constitution
by which they have since been governed.
This, with some miscellaneous papers, among
which may be mentioned the dramatic description
of the Battle of Lake Erie, comprise the
remainder of Bancroft's contribution to American
literature.</p>

<p>Bancroft said that there were three qualities
necessary to the historian: A knowledge of the
evil in human nature; that events are subordinate
to law, and that there is in man something greater
than himself. To these qualifications, which he
himself eminently possessed, may be added that
of untiring industry, which distinguished his
work. A passage was written over and over
again, sometimes as many as eight times, until
it suited him. And he was known to write an
entire volume over. He carried his labor into
his old age, being eighty-four years of age when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg 136]</span>
he made the last revision of the history which
had occupied fifty years of his life.</p>

<p>His diplomatic career also extended over many
years, he being seventy-four when at his own
request the Government recalled him from the
Court of Berlin where he was serving as Minister.</p>

<p>Bancroft died in 1891, in his ninety-second
year. The most famous of his own countrymen
united in tributes to his memory, and the sovereigns
of Europe sent wreaths to place upon his
coffin. As historian, diplomatist, and private
citizen, he had honored his country as is the
privilege of few.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>EDGAR ALLAN POE</h3>

<h4>1809-1849</h4>


<p>In the play-ground of an old-fashioned English
school the boy Edgar Allan Poe, then in
his ninth year, first entered that world of day-dreams,
whose wonders he afterward transcribed
so beautifully in his prose and poetry. The
school was situated in the old town of Stoke
Newington, and the quaint, sleepy village, with
its avenues shaded by ancient trees and bordered
by fragrant shrubberies, and with its country
stillness broken only by the chime of the church-bell
tolling the hour, seemed to the boy hardly a
part of the real world. In describing it in after
years he speaks of the dream-like and soothing
influence it had upon his early life. The school
building, also the village parsonage, as the master
of the school was a clergyman, had a similar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg 138]</span>
effect; it was a large, rambling house, whose
passages and rooms had a labyrinthine irregularity
which charmed the young student and
made him regard it almost as a place of enchantment.
It had many nooks and corners in which
one might lose one's self and dream day-dreams
out of the books, poetry and history, with which
it was pretty well stocked. The school-room
itself was low-walled and ceiled with oak, and
filled with desks and benches that had been
hacked and hewed by generations of boys. It
was of great size, and seemed to Poe the largest
in the world. In this room he studied mathematics
and the classics, while in the play-ground
outside, which was surrounded by brick walls
topped with mortar and broken glass, he spent
many of his leisure hours, taking part in those
sports so loved by the English school-boy. The
boys were allowed beyond the grounds only
three times in a week; twice on Sunday, when
they went to church, and once during the week,
when, guarded by two ushers, they were taken
a solemn walk through the neighboring fields.
All the rest of life lay within the walls that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg 139]</span>
separated the school from the village streets. In
this quiet spot Poe spent five years of his life,
speaking of them afterward as most happy years
and rich in those poetic influences which formed
his character.</p>

<p>In his thirteenth year he left England and returned
to America with his adopted parents,
Mr. and Mrs. Allan, of Baltimore, spending the
next four or five years of his life partly in their
beautiful home and partly at school in Richmond.</p>

<p>The parents of Poe had died in his infancy.
They had both possessed talent, his mother having
been an actress of considerable repute, and
from them he inherited gentle and winning
manners and a talent for declamation, which,
combined with his remarkable personal beauty,
made him a favorite in the Allan home, where
he was much petted and caressed. The child
returned the interest of his adopted parents, and
though he was sometimes wilful and obstinate
he never failed in affection. To Mrs. Allan
especially he always showed a devotion and
gratitude that well repaid her for the love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg 140]</span>
and care she had bestowed upon the orphan
child.</p>

<p>Though fond of books, especially books of
poetry, and loving to be alone in some quiet
place where he could indulge in the day-dreams
that formed so large a part of his life, Poe yet
had the fondness of a healthy boy for athletic
sports, and some of his feats of strength are still
found recorded in the old newspapers of Baltimore.
Once on a hot day he swam a distance
of seven miles on the James River against a
swift tide; in a contest he leaped twenty-one
feet on a level, and in other feats of strength he
also excelled.</p>

<p>He was very fond of animals, and was always
surrounded by pets which returned his affection
with interest, and which, with the flowers he
loved to tend and care for, took up many of his
leisure hours.</p>

<p>When he was seventeen Poe entered the University
of Virginia, where he remained not quite
a year, distinguishing himself as a student of the
classics and modern languages. Upon his return
to Baltimore he had a disagreement with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg 141]</span>
his foster-father because of some college debts,
and though Poe was very much in the wrong he
refused to admit it, and, leaving the house in a
fit of anger, went to live with his aunt, Mrs.
Clemm. He had already published a volume of
poems, and now being forced to depend upon
himself he issued a second edition. But this
brought him neither fame nor money, and after
a two years' struggle with poverty he was glad
to accept a cadetship at West Point, obtained
for him through the influence of Mr. Allan.
Mrs. Allan had in the meantime died, and in
her death Poe lost his best friend, one who had
been ever ready to forgive his faults, to believe
in his repentance, and to have faith in his promises
of amendment.</p>

<p>Poe was charmed with the life at West Point,
and in his first enthusiasm decided that a soldier's
career was the most glorious in the world.
The hard study, the strict discipline, the rigid
law and order of cadet life seemed only admirable,
and he soon stood at the head of his class.
But it was impossible that this enthusiasm
should last long. Poe was endowed by nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg 142]</span>
with the dreamy and artistic temperament of
the poet, and discipline and routine could not
fail to become in a short time unbearable.
When this period arrived the prospective life of
the soldier lost its charm, and he was seized
with a desire to leave the Academy and bid a
final farewell to military life. It was impossible
to do this without the consent of his guardian,
and as Mr. Allan refused this, Poe was
forced to carry his point in his own way. This
he did by lagging in his studies, writing poetry
when he should have been solving problems,
and refusing point blank to obey orders. Military
discipline could not long brook this. Poe
was court-martialed, and, pleading guilty, was
discharged from the Academy, disgraced but
happy. During his stay there he had published
a third edition of his poems, containing a number
of pieces not included in the other editions.
It was dedicated to his fellow-cadets, and was
subscribed for by many of the students.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after his departure from
West Point, Poe went to live with his aunt,
Mrs. Clemm, and her daughter Virginia, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg 143]</span>
afterward became his wife; and from this time
forward he never seems to have had any serious
idea of a career otherwise than literary. In
1832, when he was in his twenty-fourth year,
prizes were offered by a Baltimore paper for the
best short story and best poem that should be
presented. Among the material offered in competition
the judges found a small collection of
tales bound together, and written in neat Roman
characters. These stories were the last ones
read by the committee which had about decided
that there had been nothing offered worthy the
prize; their unmistakable signs of genius were
instantly recognized. It was decided that the
prize of one hundred dollars belonged to this
author, and out of the series the story entitled
<i>A Manuscript Found in a Bottle</i> was selected
as the prize tale, though all were so excellent
that it was difficult to determine which was best.
This little volume had been submitted by Poe,
and when the poetry came to be examined it
was found also that the best poem in the collection
was his. He was not, however, awarded
the prize for poetry, that being given to another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg 144]</span>
competitor, whose work the committee thought
worthy the second prize, in view of the fact that
Poe had obtained the first.</p>

<p>It was in this manner that Poe was introduced
to the world of literature, his previous
productions having excited no attention other
than that generally given to the work of a clever
or erratic boy. The workmanship of these stories
was so fine and the genius so apparent as to give
them a distinct place in American fiction, a
place to which at that time the promise of Hawthorne
pointed. Besides the reputation and
money thus earned, the story brought him a
stanch friend in the person of Mr. Kennedy,
one of the members of the committee, who,
from that time, was devoted to the interests of
the young author.</p>

<p>Poe now became busy with the composition
of those beautiful tales which appeared from
time to time in the periodicals of the day, and
which speedily won him a reputation both in
America and Europe. He was also employed
in editorial work for different magazines, and
became known as the first American critic who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg 145]</span>
had made criticism an art. It was his dream at
this time to establish a magazine of his own,
and for many years one project after another
with this object in view was tried and abandoned.
He was never able to start the magazine
and felt the disappointment keenly always.
Through all his disappointments he still lived
much in that dream-world which had always
been so real to him, and much of his best work
found there its inspiration. His exquisite story
of <i>Ligeia</i> came to him first in a dream. This
world, so unreal to many, was to Poe as real as
his actual life. Like Coleridge in English literature,
he had the power of presenting the
visions which came to him in sleep or in his
waking dreams, surrounded by their own atmosphere
of mystery and unreality, thus producing
an effect which awed as well as fascinated.
No other American writer has ever
brought from the dream-world such beautiful
creations, which charm and mystify at the same
time, and force the most unimaginative reader
to believe for the time in the existence of this
elusive realm of faery.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg 146]</span>

<p>Poe's poems have this same character, and
found their inspiration in the same source.</p>

<p>While engaged in editorial work in New York
Poe wrote his first great poem, <i>The Raven</i>,
which was first published under an assumed
name. It was not until he recited the poem by
request at a gathering of the literary workers of
New York that his authorship was suspected.
Immediately afterward the poem was published
under his name. It was regarded by critics in
England and America as illustrating the highest
poetic genius. From this time Poe, who had
hitherto been ranked among the best prose writers
of his native land, now took precedence
among the poets. It is, indeed, as a poet that
he is always thought of first. It was during the
next five years after the publication of <i>The
Raven</i> that he produced the series of remarkable
poems that has given him immortality. <i>The
Bells</i>, the original draft of which consisted of
only eighteen lines, is, perhaps, next to <i>The
Raven</i>, the poem that has brought him the most
fame. But the number of exquisite shorter
poems which he produced would in themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg 147]</span>
give him the highest rank as a poet. Chief
among these is the little idyll, <i>Annabel Lee</i>, a
transcription of the ideal love which existed between
Poe and his young wife.</p>

<p>While engaged in literary work in New York
Poe lived for the greater part of the time in the
suburb of Fordham, in an unpretentious but
charming cottage, bowered in trees and surrounded
by the flower garden, which was the
especial pride of the poet and his wife. Perhaps
the happiest days of his life were spent in this
quiet place, to which he would retire after the
business of the day was over, and occupy himself
with the care of the flowers and of the numerous
pet birds and animals, which were regarded
as a part of the family.</p>

<p>Over this otherwise happy existence hung
always the clouds of poverty and sickness, his
wife having been an invalid for many years. It
was in this little cottage, at a time when Poe's
fortunes were at their lowest ebb, that his wife
died amid poverty so extreme that the family
could not even afford a fire to heat the room in
which she lay dying. Poe remained at Fordham
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg 148]</span>
a little over two years after his wife's death,
leaving it only a few months before his own
death, in October, 1849.</p>

<p>Poe is undoubtedly to be ranked among the
greatest writers of American literature. His
prose works would grace any literary period;
his poetry is alive with the fire and beauty of
genius, and his criticisms marked a new era in
critical writing in America.</p>

<p>Twenty-six years after his death a monument
was erected to his memory in the city of Baltimore,
mainly through the efforts of the teachers
of the public schools. Some of the most distinguished
men of America were present at the
unveiling to do honor to the poet whose work
was such a noble contribution to the art of his
native land.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>RALPH WALDO EMERSON</h3>

<h4>1803-1882</h4>


<p>Walking the streets of Boston, in the days
when old-fashioned gambrel-roofed houses and
gardens filled the space now occupied by dingy
warehouses, might be seen a serious-eyed boy
who, whether at work or at play, seemed always
to his companions to live in a world a little different
from their own. This was not the dream-world
so familiar to childhood, but another
which few children enter, and those only who
seem destined to be teachers of their race. One
enters this world just as the world of day-dreams
is entered, by forgetting the real world for a
time and letting the mind think what thoughts
it will. In this world Milton spent many long
hours when a child, and Bunyan made immortal
in literature the memory of these dreams of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg 150]</span>
youth. Never any thought of the real world enters
this place, whose visitors see but one thing, a
vision of the soul as it journeys through life. To
Bunyan this seemed but a journey over dangerous
roads, through lonely valleys, and over steep
mountain sides; to Milton it seemed a war between
good and evil; to this little New-England
boy it seemed but a vision of duty bravely accomplished,
and in this he was true to the instincts
of that Puritan race to which he belonged. The
boy's father was the Rev. William Emerson,
pastor of the First Church in Boston, who had
died when this son, Ralph Waldo, was in his
ninth year; but for three years longer the family
continued to reside in the quaint old parsonage,
in which Emerson had been born. The
father had left his family so poor that the congregation
of the First Church voted an annuity
of five hundred dollars to the widow for seven
years, and many were the straits the little family
was put to in order to eke out a comfortable
living. The one ambition was to have the three
boys educated. An aunt who lived in the family
declared that they were born to be educated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg 151]</span>
and that it must be brought about somehow.
The mother took boarders, and the two eldest
boys, Ralph and Edward, helped do the housework.
In a little letter written to his aunt, in
his tenth year, Ralph mentions that he rose before
six in the morning in order to help his
brother make the fire and set the table for
prayers before calling his mother&mdash;so early did
the child realize that he must be the burden-sharer
of the family. Poverty there was, but
also much happiness in the old parsonage, whose
dooryard of trees and shrubs, joined on to the
neighboring gardens, made a pleasant outlook
into the world. When school work was over, and
household duty disposed of, very often the brothers
would retire to their own room and there
find their own peculiar joy in reading tales of Plutarch,
reciting poetry, and declaiming some favorite
piece, for solitude was loved by all, and the
great authors of the world were well studied by
these boys, whose bedchamber was so cold that
Plato or Cicero could only be indulged in when
the reader was wrapped so closely in his cloak
that Emerson afterward remarked, the smell of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg 152]</span>
woollen was forever afterward associated with the
Greek classics. Ralph attended the Latin Grammar
School, and had private lessons besides in
writing, which he seems to have acquired with
difficulty, one of his school-fellows telling long
afterward how his tongue moved up and down
as the pen laboriously traversed the page, and
how on one occasion he even played truant to
avoid the dreaded task, for which misdemeanor
he was promptly punished by a diet of bread and
water. It was at this period that he wrote
verses on the War of 1812, and began an epic
poem which one of his school friends illustrated.
Such skill did he attain in verse-making that his
efforts were delivered on exhibition days, being
rendered with such impressiveness by the young
author that his mates considered nothing could
be finer.</p>

<p>From the Latin school Emerson passed to
Harvard in his fifteenth year, entering as "President's
Freshman," a post which brought with it
a certain annual sum and a remission of fees in
exchange for various duties, such as summoning
unruly students to the president, announcing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg 153]</span>
orders of the faculty, and serving as waiter at
commons.</p>

<p>At college Emerson was noted as a student
more familiar with general literature than with
the college text-books, and he was an ardent
member of a little book club which met to read
and discuss current literature, the book or magazine
under discussion being generally bought by
the member who had the most pocket-money at
the time. But in spite of a dislike for routine
study, Emerson was graduated with considerable
honor, and almost immediately afterward set
about the business of school-teaching.</p>

<p>But Emerson was not able to take kindly to
teaching, and in his twenty-first year began preparations
to enter the ministry. These were interrupted
for a while by a trip South in search
of health, but he was finally able to accept a position
as assistant minister at the Second Church.
A year or two later he was again obliged to
leave his work and go abroad for his health.
After he returned home he decided to leave the
ministry, and he began that series of lectures
which speedily made him famous and which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg 154]</span>
have determined his place in American literature.</p>

<p>From this time Emerson began to be recognized
as one of the thought-leaders of his age. To
him literature appealed as a means of teaching
those spiritual lessons that brace the soul to brave
endurance. While Hawthorne was living in the
world of romance, Poe and Lowell creating
American poetry, and Bancroft and Motley placing
American historical prose on the highest level,
Emerson was throwing his genius into the form
of moral essays for the guidance of conduct. To
him had been revealed in all its purity that vision
of the perfect life which had been the inspiration
of his Puritan ancestors. And with the vision
had come that gift of expression which enabled
him to preserve it in the noblest literary form.
These essays embrace every variety of subject,
for, to a philosopher like Emerson every form of
life and every object of nature represented some
picture of the soul. When he devoted himself
to this task he followed a true light, for he
became and remains to many the inspiration
of his age, the American writer above all others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg 155]</span>
whose thought has moulded the souls of
men.</p>

<p>Much of Emerson's work found form in verse
of noble vein, for he was a poet as well as philosopher.
He also was connected with one or
two magazines, and became one of the most popular
of American lecturers; with the exception
of several visits to Europe and the time given to
his lecturing and other short trips, Emerson spent
his life at Concord, Mass. To this place came
annually, in his later years, the most gifted of his
followers, to conduct what was known as the
Concord School of Philosophy. Throughout
his whole life Emerson preserved that serenity
of soul which is the treasure of such spiritually
gifted natures.</p>

<p>He died at Concord in 1882, and was buried
in the village cemetery, which he had consecrated
thirty years before.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</h3>

<h4>1807-1882</h4>


<p>Almost any summer day in the early part of
the century a blue-eyed, brown-haired boy might
have been seen lying under a great apple-tree in
the garden of an old house in Portland, forgetful
of everything else in the world save the book
he was reading.</p>

<p>The boy was Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,
and the book might have been <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>,
<i>The Arabian Nights</i>, or <i>Don Quixote</i>, all of
which were prime favorites, or, possibly, it was
Irving's <i>Sketch-Book</i>, of which he was so fond
that even the covers delighted him, and whose
charm remained unbroken throughout life.
Years afterward, when, as a famous man of letters,
he was called upon to pay his tribute to the
memory of Irving, he could think of no more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg 157]</span>
tender praise than to speak with grateful affection
of the book which had so fascinated him as
a boy, and whose pages still led him back into
the "haunted chambers of youth."</p>

<p>Portland was in those days a town of wooden
houses, with streets shaded with trees, and the
waters of the sea almost dashing up to its doorways.
At its back great stretches of woodland
swept the country as far as the eye could see, and
low hills served as watch-towers over the deep in
times of war. It was during Longfellow's childhood
that the British ship Boxer was captured
by the Enterprise in the famous sea-fight of the
War of 1812; the two captains, who had fallen
in the battle, were buried side by side in the
cemetery at Portland, and the whole town came
together to do honor to the dead commanders.
Long afterward Longfellow speaks of this incident
in his poem entitled <i>My Lost Youth</i>,
and recalls the sound of the cannon booming
across the waters, and the solemn stillness that
followed the news of the victory.</p>

<p>It is in the same poem that we have a picture
of the Portland of his early life, and are given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg 158]</span>
glimpses of the black wet wharves, where the
ships were moored all day long as they worked,
and also the Spanish sailors "with bearded lips"
who seemed as much a mystery to the boy as the
ships themselves. These came and went across the
sea, always watched and waited for with greatest
interest by the children, who loved the excitement
of the unloading and loading, the shouts of
the surveyors who were measuring the contents
of cask and hogshead; the songs of the negroes
working the pulleys, the jolly good-nature of the
seamen strolling through the streets, and, above
all, the sight of the strange treasures that came
from time to time into one home or another&mdash;bits
of coral, beautiful sea-shells, birds of resplendent
plumage, foreign coins, which looked odd even
in Portland, where all the money nearly was
Spanish&mdash;and the hundred and one things dear
to the hearts of children and sailors.</p>

<p>Longfellow's boyhood was almost a reproduction
of that of some Puritan ancestor a century
before. He attended the village school, played
ball in summer and skated in winter, went to
church twice every Sunday, and, when service was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg 159]</span>
over, looked at the curious pictures in the family
Bible, and heard from his mother's lips the stories
of David and Jonathan and Joseph, and at all
times had food for his imagination in the view
of bay stretching seaward, on one hand, and on
the other valley farms and groves spreading out
to the west.</p>

<p>But although the life was severe in its simplicity,
it was most sweet and wholesome for the
children who grew up in the home nest, guarded
by the love that was felt rather than expressed,
and guided into noble conceptions of the beauty
and dignity of living. This home atmosphere
impressed itself upon Longfellow unconsciously,
as did the poetic influences of nature, and had
just as lasting and inspiring an effect upon his
character, so that truth, duty, fine courage were
always associated with the freshness of spring, the
early dawn, the summer sunshine, and the lingering
sadness of twilight.</p>

<p>It is the spiritual insight, thus early developed,
that gives to Longfellow's poetry some of its
greatest charms.</p>

<p>It was during his school-boy days that Longfellow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg 160]</span>
published his first bit of verse. It was
inspired by hearing the story of a famous fight
which took place on the shores of a small lake
called Lovell's Pond, between the hero Lovell
and the Indians. Longfellow was deeply impressed
by this story and threw his feeling of admiration
into four stanzas, which he carried with
a beating heart down to the letter-box of the
<i>Portland Gazette</i>, taking an opportunity to slip
the manuscript in when no one was looking.</p>

<p>A few days later Longfellow watched his father
unfold the paper, read it slowly before the fire,
and finally leave the room, when the sheet was
grasped by the boy and his sister, who shared his
confidence, and hastily scanned. The poem was
there in the "Poets' Corner" of the <i>Gazette</i>, and
Longfellow was so filled with joy that he spent
the greater part of the remainder of the day in
reading and re-reading the verses, becoming convinced
toward evening that they possessed remarkable
merit. His happiness was dimmed,
however, a few hours later, when the father
of a boy friend, with whom he was passing the
evening, pronounced the verses stiff and entirely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg 161]</span>
lacking in originality, a criticism that was quite
true and that was harder to bear because the
critic had no idea who the author was. Longfellow
slipped away as soon as possible to nurse
his wounded feelings in his own room, but instead
of letting the incident discourage him,
began, with renewed vigor, to write verses, epigrams,
essays, and even tragedies, which he produced
in a literary partnership with one of his
friends. None of these effusions had any literary
value, being no better than any boy of thirteen
or fourteen would produce if he turned his
attention to composition instead of bat and ball.</p>

<p>Longfellow remained in Portland until his
sixteenth year, when he went to Bowdoin College,
entering the sophomore class. Here he
remained for three years, gradually winning a
name for scholarship and character that was
second to none.</p>

<p>His love for reading still continued, Irving remaining
a favorite author, while Cooper was also
warmly appreciated. From the <i>Sketch-Book</i> he
would turn to the exciting pages of <i>The Spy</i>,
and the announcement of a new work by either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg 162]</span>
of their authors was looked forward to as an
event of supreme importance. From time to
time he wrote verses which appeared in the
periodicals of the day, and as his college life
neared its close he began to look toward literature
as the field for his future work, and it was
with much disappointment that he learned that
his father wished him to study law.</p>

<p>But what the effect of such a course may have
had upon his mind so filled with the love of
poetry, and so consecrated to the ideal, will
never be known, as the end of his college life
brought to him a chance which, for the moment,
entirely satisfied the desire of his heart.</p>

<p>This was an offer from the college trustees
that he should visit Europe for the purpose
of fitting himself for a professorship of modern
languages, and that upon his return he
should fill that chair, newly established at Bowdoin.</p>

<p>This was the happiest fortune that could
come to Longfellow in the beginning of his
literary career. Accordingly, at the age of
nineteen, he sailed for France in good health,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg 163]</span>
with fine prospects, and with as fair a hope for
the future as ever was given.</p>

<p>Longfellow remained abroad three years,
studying and absorbing all the new conditions
which were broadening his mind, and fitting him
for his after-career. He visited France, Spain,
Italy, and Germany, meeting with adventure
everywhere, and storing up memory after memory
that came back to his call in after-years to
serve some purpose of his art.</p>

<p>We have thus preserved in his works the impressions
that Europe then made upon a young
American, who had come there to supplement
his education by studying at the universities,
and whose mind was alive to all the myriad
forms of culture denied in his own land.</p>

<p>The vividness of these early impressions was
seen in all his work, and was perhaps the first
reflection of the old poetic European influence
that began to be felt in much American poetry,
where the charm of old peasant love-songs and
roundelays, heard for centuries among the lower
classes of Spain, France, and Italy, was wrought
into translations and transcriptions so perfect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg 164]</span>
and spirited that they may almost rank with
original work.</p>

<p>One of Longfellow's great pleasures while on
this trip was the meeting with Irving in Spain,
where the latter was busy upon his <i>Life of Columbus</i>;
and Irving's kindness on this occasion
was always affectionately remembered.</p>

<p>Longfellow returned to America after three
years' absence, and at once began his duties at
Bowdoin College, where he remained three
years, when he left to take a professorship at
Harvard, which he had accepted with the understanding
that he was to spend a year and a half
abroad before commencing his work.</p>

<p>The results of his literary labors while at
Bowdoin were the publication of a series of
sketches of European life called <i>Outre Mer</i>,
in two volumes; a translation from the Spanish
of the <i>Coplas de Manrique</i>, and some essays
in the <i>North American Review</i> and other periodicals.
And considering the demand upon his
time which his college duties made, this amount
of finished work speaks well for his industry,
since it does not include a number of text-books
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg 165]</span>
prepared for the use of his pupils, and numberless
papers, translations, and other literary miscellany
necessary to his work as a teacher of
foreign languages. <i>Outre Mer</i>, which had
first appeared in part in a periodical, was very
favorably received. It was really the story of
picturesque Europe translated by the eye and
heart of a young poet.</p>

<p>After his return to America Longfellow settled
down to the routine of college work, which
was interrupted for the next ten years only by his
literary work, which from this time on began to
absorb him more and more. Two years after his
return he published his first volume of poems and
his romance <i>Hyperion</i>. In <i>Hyperion</i> Longfellow
related some of the experiences of his own
travels under the guise of the hero, who wanders
through Europe, and the book is full of the
same biographical charm that belongs to <i>Outre
Mer</i>. Here the student life of the German
youth, the songs they sang, the books they read,
and even their favorite inns are noted, while
the many translations of German poetry opened
a new field of delight to American readers. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg 166]</span>
was well received by the public, who appreciated
its fine poetic fancy and its wealth of
serious thought.</p>

<p>But it was not by his prose that Longfellow
touched the deepest sympathies of his readers,
and the publication of his first volume
of poetry a few months later showed his real
position in the world of American letters. This
little book, which was issued under the title
<i>Voices of the Night</i>, consisted of the poems
that had so far appeared in the various magazines
and papers, a few poems written in his
college days, and some translations from the
French, German, and Spanish poets.</p>

<p>In this volume occurs some of Longfellow's
choicest works, the gem of the book being the
celebrated <i>A Psalm of Life</i>.</p>

<p>It is from this point that Longfellow goes onward
always as the favorite poet of the American
people. The <i>Psalm of Life</i> had been published
previously in a magazine without the
author's name, and it had no sooner been read
than it seemed to find its way into every heart.
Ministers read it to their congregations all over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg 167]</span>
the country, and it was sung as a hymn in many
churches. It was copied in almost every newspaper
in the United States; it was recited in
every school. To young and old alike it brought
its message, and its voice was recognized as that
of a true leader. The author of <i>Outre Mer</i>
and <i>Hyperion</i> had here touched hands with
millions of his brothers and sisters, and the clasp
was never unloosened again while he lived.</p>

<p>In the same collection occurs <i>The Footsteps
of Angels</i>, another well-beloved poem, and one
in which the spirit of home-life is made the inspiration.</p>

<p>Longfellow's poems now followed one another
in rapid succession, appearing generally at first
in some magazine and afterward in book form
in various collections under different titles.</p>

<p>His greatest contributions to American literature
are his <i>Evangeline</i> and <i>Hiawatha</i>, and a
score of shorter poems, which in themselves
would give the author a high place in any literature.</p>

<p>In <i>Evangeline</i> Longfellow took for his theme
the pathetic story of the destruction of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg 168]</span>
Acadian villages by the English during the struggle
between the English and French for the possession
of Canada. In this event many families
and friends were separated never again to be reunited,
and the story of <i>Evangeline</i> is the fate
of two young lovers who were sent away from
their homes in different ships, and who never
met again until both were old, and one was
dying in the ward of a public hospital. Longfellow
has made of this sad story a wondrously
beautiful tale, that reads like an old legend of
Grecian Arcadia.</p>

<p>The description of the great primeval forests,
stretching down to the sea; of the villages and
farms scattered over the land as unprotected as
the nests of the meadow lark; of the sowing
and harvesting of the peasant folk, with their
<i>f&#234;tes</i> and churchgoing, their weddings and festivals,
and the pathetic search of Evangeline for
her lost lover Gabriel among the plains of
Louisiana, all show Longfellow in his finest
mood as a poet whom the sorrows of mankind
touched always with reverent pity, as well as a
writer of noble verse.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg 169]</span>

<p>Everywhere that the English language is read
<i>Evangeline</i> has passed as the most beautiful folk-story
that America has produced, and the French
Canadians, the far-away brothers of the Acadians,
have included Longfellow among their
national poets. Among them <i>Evangeline</i> is
known by heart, and the cases are not rare
where the people have learned English expressly
for the purpose of reading Longfellow's poem in
the original, a wonderful tribute to the poet who
could thus touch to music one of the saddest
memories of their race.</p>

<p>In <i>Hiawatha</i> Longfellow gave to the Indian
the place in poetry that had been given him by
Cooper in prose. Here the red man is shown
with all his native nobleness still unmarred by
the selfish injustice of the whites, while his inferior
qualities are seen only to be those that
belong to mankind in general.</p>

<p><i>Hiawatha</i> is a poem of the forests and of the
dark-skinned race who dwelt therein, who were
learned only in forest lore and lived as near to
nature's heart as the fauns and satyrs of old.
Into this legend Longfellow has put all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg 170]</span>
poetry of the Indian nature, and has made his
hero, Hiawatha, a noble creation that compares
favorably with the King Arthur of the old
British romances. Like Arthur, Hiawatha has
come into the world with a mission for his people;
his birth is equally mysterious and invests
him at once with almost supernatural qualities.
Like Arthur, he seeks to redeem his kingdom
from savagery and to teach the blessing of peace.</p>

<p>From first to last Hiawatha moves among
the people, a real leader, showing them how to
clear their forests, to plant grain, to make for
themselves clothing of embroidered and painted
skins, to improve their fishing-grounds, and to
live at peace with their neighbors. Hiawatha's
own life was one that was lived for others.
From the time when he was a little child and
his grandmother told him all the fairy-tales of
nature, up to the day when, like Arthur, he
passed mysteriously away through the gates of
the sunset, all his hope and joy and work were
for his people. He is a creature that could only
have been born from a mind as pure and poetic
as that of Longfellow.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg 171]</span>

<p>All the scenes and images of the poem are so
true to nature that they seem like very breaths
from the forest. We move with Hiawatha
through the dewy birchen aisles, learn with him
the language of the nimble squirrel and of the
wise beaver and mighty bear, watch him build
his famous canoe, and spend hours with him
fishing in the waters of the great inland sea,
bordered by the pictured rocks, painted by nature
herself. Longfellow's first idea of the poem
was suggested, it is said, by his hearing a Harvard
student recite some Indian tales. Searching
among the various books that treated of the
American Indian, he found many legends and
incidents that preserved fairly well the traditional
history of the Indian race, and grouping
these around one central figure and filling in the
gaps with poetic descriptions of the forests,
mountains, lakes, rivers, and plains, which made
up the abode of these picturesque people, he
thus built up the entire poem. The metre used
is that in which the Kalevala, the national epic
of the Finns is written, and the Finnish hero,
Wainamoinen, in his gift of song and his brave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg 172]</span>
adventures, is not unlike the great Hiawatha.
Among Longfellow's other long poems are:
<i>The Spanish Student</i>, a dramatic poem founded
upon a Spanish romance; <i>The Divine Tragedy</i>,
and <i>The Golden Legend</i>, founded upon the life
of Christ; <i>The Courtship of Miles Standish</i>,
a tale of Puritan love-making in the time of
the early settlers, and <i>Tales of a Wayside Inn</i>,
which were a series of poems of adventure supposed
to be related in turn by the guests at an
inn.</p>

<p>But it is with such poems as <i>Evangeline</i> and
<i>Hiawatha</i>, and the shorter famous poems like <i>A
Psalm of Life</i>, <i>Excelsior</i>, <i>The Wreck of the Hesperus</i>,
<i>The Building of the Ship</i>, <i>The Footsteps
of Angels</i> that his claim as the favorite poet
of America rests. <i>Evangeline</i> and <i>Hiawatha</i>
marked an era in American literature in introducing
themes purely American, while of the
famous shorter poems each separate one was
greeted almost with an ovation. <i>The Building
of the Ship</i> was never read during the struggle
of the Civil War without raising the audience
to a passion of enthusiasm, and so in each of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg 173]</span>
these shorter poems Longfellow touched with
wondrous sympathy the hearts of his readers.
Throughout the land he was revered as the poet
of the home and heart, the sweet singer to
whom the fireside and family gave ever sacred
and beautiful meanings.</p>

<p>Some poems on slavery, a prose tale called
<i>Kavanagh</i>, and a translation of <i>The Divine
Comedy</i> of Dante must also be included among
Longfellow's works; but these have never
reached the success attained by his more popular
poems which are known by heart by millions
to whom they have been inspiration and
comfort.</p>

<p>Longfellow died in Cambridge in 1882, in
the same month in which was written his last
poem, <i>The Bells of San Blas</i>, which concludes
with these words:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"It is daybreak everywhere."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>JOHN LOTHROP MOTLEY</h3>

<h4>1814-1877</h4>


<p>One day in the year 1827, a boy of thirteen first
entered the chapel of Harvard College to take
his seat there as a student. His schoolfellows
looked at him curiously first, because of his remarkable
beauty, and second because of his reputation
as a linguist, a great distinction among
boys who looked upon foreign tongues as so
many traps for tripping their unlucky feet in the
thorny paths of learning. He had come to Harvard
from Mr. Bancroft's school at Northampton,
where he was famous as a reader, writer,
and orator, and was more admired, perhaps, than
is good for any boy. Both pupils and masters
recognized his talents and overlooked his lack of
industry. But neither dreamed that their praise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg 175]</span>
was but the first tribute to the genius of the
future historian, John Lothrop Motley.</p>

<p>Motley was born in Dorchester, a suburb of
Boston, April 15, 1814. As a child he was delicate,
a condition which fostered his great natural
love for reading. He devoured books of every
kind, history, poetry, plays, orations, and particularly
the novels of Cooper and Scott. Not satisfied
with reading about heroes, he must be a
hero himself, and when scarcely eight he bribed
a younger brother with sweetmeats to lie quiet,
wrapped in a shawl, while he, mounted upon a
stool, delivered Mark Antony's oration over the
dead body of C&#230;sar. At eleven he began a
novel, the scene of which was laid in the Housatonic
Valley, because that name sounded grand
and romantic. On Saturday afternoon he and
his playmates, among whom was Wendell Phillips,
would assemble in the garret of the Motley
house, and in plumed hats and doublets enact
tragedies or stirring melodramas. Comedy was
too frivolous for these entertainments, in which
Motley was always the leading spirit; the chief
bandit, the heavy villain, the deadliest foe.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg 176]</span>

<p>In the school-room also Motley led by divine
right, and expected others to follow. Thus, in
spite of his dislike for rigid rules of study, he was
always before the class as one to be deferred to
and honored wherever honor might be given.
While still at college Motley seems to have had
some notion of a literary career. His writing-desk
was constantly crammed with manuscripts
of plays, poetry, and sketches of character, which
never found their way to print, and which were
burned to make room for others when the desk
became too full. With the exception of a few
verses published in a magazine, this work of his
college days served only for pastime. Graduated
from Harvard at seventeen, Motley spent the
next two years at a German university, where he
lived the pleasant, social life of the German student,
one of his friends and classmates being
young Bismarck, afterward the great Chancellor,
who was always fond of the handsome young
American, whose wit was the life of the student
company and whose powers of argument surpassed
his own.</p>

<p>Coming back to America, Motley studied law
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg 177]</span>
until 1841, when, in his twenty-seventh year, he
received the appointment of Secretary of Legation
to St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>His friends now looked forward to a brilliant
diplomatic career for him, but the unfavorable
climate soon led him to resign the appointment
and return to America. But the St. Petersburg
visit was not fruitless, for three years afterward
he published an essay in the <i>North American
Review</i> which showed a keen appreciation of
Russian political conditions. The article was
called "A Memoir of the Life of Peter the
Great," and its appearance surprised the critics
who had justly condemned a novel previously
published by the young author. His essay portrayed
the character of the great Peter, half king
and half savage. It showed a full appreciation
of the difficulties that hindered the establishment
of a great monarchy, and paid due honor
to that force of will, savage courage, and ideal
patriotism that laid the foundations of Russia's
greatness. The reader is made to see this fiery
Sclav, building up a new Russia from his ice-fields
and barren valleys; a Russia of great cities,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg 178]</span>
imperial armies, vast commerce, and splendid
hopes. It was a brilliant and scholarly narrative
of the achievement of a great man, and it placed
Motley among the writers of highest promise.</p>

<p>A year later he began collecting materials for
the serious work of his life. For his subject he
chose the story of the old Frisians or Hollanders
who rescued from the sea a few islands formed
by the ooze and slime of ages, and laid thereon
the foundations of a great nation. They raised
dykes to keep back the sea, built canals to serve as
roads, turned bogs into pasture-lands and morasses
into grain-fields, fought with the Romans,
founded cities, laid the foundations of the vast
maritime commerce of to-day, and finally, in the
sixteenth century, when the wealth of their merchants,
the power of their cities, and the progress
of their arts were the wonder of the world, met
their worst foe in the person of their own king,
Philip II.</p>

<p>From the beginning the Hollanders or Netherlanders
had cherished a savage independence
which commanded respect even in barbarous ages,
and this characteristic insured a quarrel between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg 179]</span>
them and their ruler. Philip II. was King of
Spain and of Sicily as well as of Holland. Born
in Spain, he could not speak a word of Dutch. He
was haughty, overbearing, and unscrupulous, and
he resolved to make the Hollanders see in him a
master as well as a king. Already in his father's
reign there had been trouble because of the growing
Protestantism which many of the Hollanders
favored. Already some of the chief Dutch cities
had been punished for resisting the Emperor's
authority, and their burghers sentenced to kneel
in sackcloth and beg him to spare their homes
from destruction. These things happened in his
father's time and had made an impression upon
Philip II., who saw that in every case the royal
power had been triumphant, and he believed himself
invincible.</p>

<p>Motley painted the life of Philip from the day
of his inauguration through all the years of revolt,
bloodshed, and horror which marked his
reign. He saw that this rebellion of the Hollanders
meant less the discontent of a people with
their king than the growth of a great idea, the
idea that civil and religious liberty is the right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg 180]</span>
of all men and nations. To Motley's mind the
struggle seemed like some old battle between
giants and Titans. Unlike other historians, who
looked over the world for a subject, rejecting first
one and then another, Motley's subject took possession
of him and would not be rejected. His
work was born, as a great poem or picture is born,
from a glimpse of things hidden from other eyes.</p>

<p>But at once he discovered that Prescott had
already in contemplation a history of Philip II.
This was a severe blow to all his hopes. But he
resolved to see Prescott, lay the matter before
him, and abide by his decision, feeling that the
master of history, who was the author of the
<i>Conquest of Mexico</i> and the <i>Conquest of Peru</i>,
would be the best adviser of a young and unknown
writer.</p>

<p>Prescott received the idea with the most generous
kindness, advised Motley to undertake
the work, and placed at his disposal all the material
which he himself had collected for his own
enterprise.</p>

<p>After several years the book appeared in 1856,
under the title <i>The Rise of the Dutch Republic</i>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg 181]</span>

<p>To write this book Motley dwelt for years in
the world of three hundred years ago, when the
whole of Europe was shaken by the new Protestantism,
when Raleigh and Drake were sailing
the Atlantic and adding the shores of the new
world to English dominion, the French settling
Canada and the Mississippi Valley, Spain sending
her mission priests to California, and the
Huguenots establishing themselves in Florida.
Thus the foundations of the American Republic
were being laid, while Philip was striving to
overthrow the freedom of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Leaving the nineteenth century as far behind
him as he could, Motley established himself successively
at Berlin, Dresden, The Hague, and
Brussels, in order to consult the libraries and
archives of state which contained documents relating
to the revolt of the Netherlands against
Philip II. In speaking of his work in the libraries
of Brussels, he says that at this time only
dead men were his familiar friends, and that he
was at home in any country, and he calls himself
a worm feeding on musty mulberry leaves out of
which he was to spin silk. Day after day, year
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg 182]</span>
after year, he haunted the old libraries, whose
shadows held so many secrets of the past, until
the personalities of those great heroes who
fought for the liberty of Holland were as familiar
as the faces of his own children. William
of Orange, called the Silent, the Washington of
Dutch independence, Count Egmont, Van Horn,
and all that band of heroes who espoused the
cause of liberty, came to be comrades.</p>

<p>And the end rewarded the years of toil. Out
of old mouldy documents and dead letters Motley
recreated the Netherlands of the sixteenth
century. Again were seen the great cities with
their walls miles in extent, their gay streets, their
palaces and churches, and public buildings, and
the great domains of the clergy, second to none
in Europe. The nobles possessed magnificent
estates and entertained their guests with jousts
and tourneys like the great lords of England and
France. The tradespeople and artisans who comprised
the population of the cities were divided
into societies or guilds, which were so powerful
that no act of state could be passed without their
consent, and so rich that to their entertainments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg 183]</span>
the proudest nobles came as guests, to see a
luxuriousness which vied with that of kings. The
Dutch artists were celebrated for their noble
pictures, for their marvellous skill in wood and
stone carving, and for the wonderful tapestries
which alone would have made Dutch art famous.</p>

<p>In the midst of this prosperity Philip II.
came to the throne, and soon after his coronation
the entire Netherlands were in revolt.
Motley has described this struggle like an eye-witness.
We see the officers of the Inquisition
dragging their victims daily to the torture-chamber,
and the starved and dying rebels defending
their cities through sieges which the Spanish
army made fiendish in suffering. Motley's description
of the siege of Leyden, and his portrait
of William the Silent, are among the finest specimens
of historical composition.</p>

<p>The work ends with the death of the Prince
of Orange, this tragic event forming a fitting
climax to the great revolution which had acknowledged
him its hope and leader.</p>

<p>Motley carried the completed manuscript of
<i>The Rise of the Dutch Republic</i> to London,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg 184]</span>
but failing to find a publisher willing to undertake
such a work by an unknown author, he was
obliged to produce it at his own expense. It
met with the most flattering reception, and the
reviews which appeared in England, France, and
America placed Motley's name among the great
historians. The book was soon translated into
Dutch, German, and Russian.</p>

<p>Motley's two other great works were similar
in character to the first. The second work,
called <i>The History of the United Netherlands</i>,
began with the death of William the Silent, and
ended with the period known as the Twelve
Years' Truce, when by common consent the independence
of the Netherlands was recognized
throughout Europe.</p>

<p>This work consists of four volumes, the first
two having been published in 1860, and the remaining
two in 1867.</p>

<p>These volumes embrace much of the history
of England, which became the ally and friend of
Holland, and are full of the great events which
made up that epoch of English history. The
names of Queen Elizabeth, the Duke of Leicester,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg 185]</span>
Lord Burghley, and the noble and chivalrous
Sir Philip Sidney, who lost his life on one
of the battle-fields of this war, figure as largely
in its pages as those of the Dutch themselves.
The war had ceased to be the revolt of Holland
against Spain, and had become a mighty battle
for the liberty of Europe. Every nation was
interested in its progress, and all men knew that
upon its success or failure would depend the
fate of Europe for many centuries. In this
work Motley's pen lost none of its art. The
chapters follow one another in harmonious succession,
the clear and polished style giving no
hint of the obscurities of diplomatic letters, the
almost illegible manuscripts, and the contradictory
reports which often made up the original
materials.</p>

<p>Like its predecessor, it was at once classed
among the great histories of the world. <i>The
Life of John of Barneveld</i>, who shares with
William of Orange the glory of achieving Dutch
independence, was the subject of Motley's next
and last work. The book is not in a strict sense
a biography. It is rather a narrative of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg 186]</span>
quarrel of the Netherlands among themselves
over theological questions. The country was
now Protestant, and yet the people fought as
fiercely over the different points of doctrine
as when they were struggling for their independence.
The book appeared in 1874, completing
the series, which the author called <i>The
History of the Eighty Years' War for Independence</i>.</p>

<p>During this period of literary work Motley
was twice appointed to represent the United
States at foreign courts. He was Minister to
Austria from 1861 to 1866, and during the
stormy period of the Civil War showed his
powers as a statesman in his diplomatic relations
with the Austrian Court, which honored him
always both as a diplomatist and as a patriot,
his devotion to his country being a proverb
among his fellows.</p>

<p>In 1868 he was appointed Minister to England,
but held the office only two years. On both
these occasions Motley proved his ability to
meet and master questions of state, and there is
no doubt that, had fortune led him into active
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg 187]</span>
political life, he would have made a brilliant reputation.</p>

<p>He died in May, 1877, and was buried in
Kensal Green Cemetery, near London, England.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>HARRIET BEECHER STOWE</h3>

<h4>1811-1896</h4>


<p>Harriet Beecher Stowe, the first distinguished
woman writer of America, was born at Litchfield,
Conn., in those old New England days
when children were taught that good little girls
must always speak gently, never tear their
clothes, learn to knit and sew, and make all the
responses properly in church. Such is her own
story of her early education, to which is also
added the item that on Sunday afternoons she
was expected to repeat the catechism, and on
the occasion of a visit to her grandmother, her
aunt made her learn two catechisms, that of her
own faith, the Episcopal, and that of Harriet's
father, who was a Presbyterian minister. This
discipline, however, had no depressing effect
upon the child, whose family consisted of a half-dozen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg 189]</span>
healthy, clever brothers and sisters, a
father who was loved more than revered even in
those days when a minister was regarded with
awe, and a stepmother whose devotion made
the home-life a thing of beauty to be held in all
after-years in loving memory.</p>

<p>The old Presbyterian parsonage where Harriet
was born had in it one room that was the
child's chief delight. This was her father's
study, in a corner of which she loved to ensconce
herself with her favorite books gathered
around her, and read or day-dream, while her
father sat opposite in his great writing-chair composing
the sermon for the next Sunday. Children's
books were not plentiful in those days,
and Miss Edgeworth's <i>Tales</i> and Cotton Mather's
<i>Magnalia</i> were her principal resource, until
one joyful day, rummaging in a barrel of old sermons,
she came upon a copy of <i>The Arabian
Nights</i>. These flowers of fairy lore took healthy
root in the imagination of the little Puritan
child, whose mind had hitherto resembled the
prim flower-beds of the New England gardens,
where grew only native plants. The old stories
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg 190]</span>
opened a new world of thought, and into this
unknown realm she entered, rambling amid such
wonderful scenes that never again could their
mysterious charm cease; when some time later
her father came down from his study one day
with a volume of <i>Ivanhoe</i> in his hand, and said:
"I did not intend that my children should ever
read novels, but they must read Scott," another
door into the realm of fairy was opened to the
delighted child.</p>

<p>This power to lift and lose herself in a region
of thought so different from her own, became
thereafter the peculiar gift by which she was enabled
to undertake the work which made her
name distinguished.</p>

<p>The library corner, however, did not hold all
the good things of life, only part of them. Outside
was the happy world of a healthy country
child, who grew as joyously as one of her own
New England flowers. In the spring there
were excursions in the woods and fields after the
wild blossoms that once a year turned the country-side
into fairy-land; in the summer was the
joy of picnics in the old forests, and of fishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg 191]</span>
excursions along the banks of the streams; in
the autumn came nutting parties, when the children
ran races with the squirrels to see who
could gather the most nuts; and in the winter,
when the snow and ice covered the earth, life
went on as gayly as ever, with coasting and snow-balling,
and the many ways in which the child's
heart tunes itself to the spirit of nature.</p>

<p>By the time she was five years old Harriet
was a regular pupil at a small school near by,
whither she also conducted, day after day, her
younger brother, Henry Ward Beecher, afterward
the celebrated preacher. She was a very
conscientious little pupil, and besides her school
lessons, was commended for having learned
twenty-seven hymns and two long chapters in the
Bible during one summer. School-life henceforth
was the serious business of existence, and in her
twelfth year she appears as one of the honor pupils
at the yearly school exhibition, and was gratified
by having her composition read in the presence
of the distinguished visitors, her father, the
minister, being among the number. The subject
of the composition was the immortality of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg 192]</span>
the soul, and into it Harriet had woven, as only
a clever child could, all the serious thoughts that
she had gleaned from theological volumes in the
library, or sermons that her father preached, or
from the grave conversations that were common
among the elders of the family. It was
listened to with great approval by the visitors,
who saw nothing absurd in the idea of a child of
twelve discoursing upon such a subject, and it
was especially pleasing to Harriet's father, which
so delighted the affectionate heart of the little
writer that she felt no higher reward could be
hers.</p>

<p>Harriet's first flight from the home nest came
in her thirteenth year, when she left Litchfield
to attend her sister Catherine's school in Hartford.
As her father's salary did not permit any
extra expense, Harriet went to live in the family
of a friend, who in turn sent his daughter to
the parsonage at Litchfield that she might attend
the seminary there. This exchange of daughters
was a very happy arrangement as far as Harriet
was concerned, as she enjoyed the responsibility
of being so much her own guardian, and took care
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg 193]</span>
of herself and her little room with what she herself
calls "awful satisfaction."</p>

<p>Here she began the study of Latin, which fascinated
her, the Latin poetry making such an impression
on her mind that it became her dream to
be a poet. Pages and pages of manuscript were
now written in the preparation of a great drama
called "Cleon," the scene of which was laid in the
time of the Emperor Nero. Every moment that
could be spared from actual duties was given to
this play, which might have grown to volumes
had not the young author been suddenly brought
up sharply by her sister, who advised her to stop
writing poetry and discipline her mind. Whereupon
Harriet plunged into a course of Butler's
<i>Analogy</i> and other heavy reading, forgot all
about the drama, and was so wrought upon by
Baxter's <i>Saint's Rest</i> that she longed for nothing
but to die and be in heaven.</p>

<p>The next years of Harriet's life were spent
almost entirely at the Hartford school, where
she was successively pupil and teacher until her
father removed to Cincinnati, whither she accompanied
him with the intention of helping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg 194]</span>
her sister to found a college for women. And,
although all undreamed of, it was in this place
that she was first to feel the inspiration of the
work that made her famous. During a short
visit across the Ohio River into Kentucky, she
saw for the first time a large plantation and
something of the life of the negro slaves.
Though apparently noticing little of what was
before her eyes, she was really absorbing everything
with all the keenness of a first impression.
The mansion of the planter and the humble cot
of the negro, the funny pranks and songs of the
slaves, and the pathos that touched their lives,
all appealed to her so strongly that, years afterward,
she was able to reproduce with utmost
faithfulness each picturesque detail of plantation
life.</p>

<p>In her twenty-fifth year Harriet was married
to Professor Stowe, of Lane Seminary. She had
for some time been a contributor to various
periodicals, and continued her literary work after
her marriage, producing only short sketches
for various papers, an elementary geography, and
a collection of sketches in book form under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg 195]</span>
title, <i>The Mayflower</i>. These efforts had been
well received by publishers, and friends prophesied
a satisfactory career, but it was many years
afterward before the author gave herself to the
literary life with the earnestness and devotion
which so characterized her nature.</p>

<p>Some of her experiences in this Western home,
where living was so primitive, were very funny,
and some were very trying; but through them
all Mrs. Stowe kept a clear head and brave
heart. Sometimes she would be left without
warning with the entire care of her house and
children; often her literary work was done at
the sick-bed of a child; and more than once a
promised story was written in the intervals of
baking, cooking, and the superintendence of
other household matters; one of her stories at
this time was finished at the kitchen table,
while every other sentence was addressed to the
ignorant maid, who stood stupidly awaiting instructions
about the making of brown bread.</p>

<p>After seventeen years' experience in the Western
colleges, Professor Stowe accepted a professorship
at Bowdoin, and the family removed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg 196]</span>
Brunswick, Me. Here her stories and sketches,
some humorous, some pathetic, still continued to
add to the household's income, and many a comfort
that would have been otherwise unknown
was purchased with the money thus obtained.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stowe's first important book took the
form of an appeal for the freedom of the slaves
of the South. One day, while attending communion
service in the college chapel, she saw, as
in a mental picture, the death-scene of Uncle
Tom, afterward described in her celebrated book.
Returning home, she wrote out the first draft of
that immortal chapter, and calling her children
around her read it to them. The two eldest wept
at the sad story, which from this beginning grew
into the book which made its author famous over
the civilized world. In <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> it
was Mrs. Stowe's aim to present the every-day
life of the Southern plantation. She chose for
her hero one of those typical negro characters
whose faithfulness and loyalty would so well
illustrate the fidelity of his race, while his sad
story would make an appeal for the freedom of
his people.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg 197]</span>

<p>Into this story she wove descriptions of Southern
life, delineations of negro character, and so
many incidents, pathetic and humorous, that it
seemed to present when finished a life-like picture
of plantation life. The pathetic figure of Uncle
Tom, the sweet grace of Eva, the delightful
Topsy, and the grim Yankee spinster show alike
the sympathetic heart and mind of the author,
who linked them so closely together in the invisible
bonds of love. The beautiful tribute that
St. Clair pays to his mother's influence in one of
the striking passages of the book, was but a
memory of Mrs. Stowe's own mother, who died
when her daughter was four years old. No one
could read this pathetic tale without being touched
by the sorrows beneath which the negro race had
bowed for generations, and through which he still
kept a loyal love for his white master, a pride
in the family of which he counted himself a
member, and that pathetic patience which had
been the birthright of his people.</p>

<p>The book <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, or <i>Life Among
the Lowly</i>, ran first as a serial, and came out in
book form in 1852. Into it the author had thrown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg 198]</span>
all the seriousness of her nature, and it met with
overwhelming success. It was translated into
twenty different languages, and Uncle Tom and
Eva passed, like the shadow and sunlight of their
native land, hand in hand into the homes, great
and humble, of widely scattered nations.</p>

<p>Another plea for the negro called <i>Dred, a
Tale of the Dismal Swamp</i>, followed <i>Uncle
Tom's Cabin</i> within a few years, after which
Mrs. Stowe turned her attention to the material
that lay closer at hand, and began the publication
of a series of New England life. Into these she
put such a wealth of sympathetic reminiscences,
with such a fund of keen observation, that they
stand easily as types of the home-life of her native
hills. The first of this series was <i>The Minister's
Wooing</i>, a story of a New England minister's
love. It is full of the sights and scenes familiar
to the author from childhood, and is a faithful
picture of Puritan village life, wherein are introduced
many characters as yet new in fiction.
Unlike Hawthorne, who sought inspiration in
the spiritual questions which so largely made up
the life of the Puritans, Mrs. Stowe found her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg 199]</span>
delight in giving the home-life, the household
ambitions, the village interests, a place in literature,
thus preserving a phase of society which
has passed away even in her own lifetime.</p>

<p><i>The Minister's Wooing</i> appeared simultaneously
with <i>The Pearl of Orr's Island</i>, a tale of the
Maine coast, in which are introduced an aged
fisherman and his old brown sea-chest, and other
characters and accessories all imbued with the
true sea flavor and forming a story which Whittier
pronounced the most charming New England
idyll ever written.</p>

<p>In <i>Old Town Folks</i>, the most delightful perhaps
of her New England stories, Mrs. Stowe
has drawn the character of Harry from the
memory of her husband's childhood. Professor
Stowe had been one of those imaginative children,
who, when alone, conjure up visions of
fairies and genii to people empty space. He
spent many an hour in following the pranks of
these unreal people. He imagined that these
creatures of his brain could pass through the floor
and ceiling, float in the air and flit through
meadow or wood, sometimes even rising to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg 200]</span>
stars. Sometimes they took the form of friendly
brownies who would thresh straw and beans.
Two resembled an old Indian man and woman
who fought for the possession of a base viol.
Another group was of all colors and had no shape
at all; while the favorite was in human form
and came and answered to the name of Harry.</p>

<p>Besides her New England tales, Mrs. Stowe
wrote a charming novel, <i>Agnes of Sorrento</i>, the
scene of which is laid in Italy.</p>

<p><i>Little Foxes</i>, <i>Queer Little People</i>, and <i>Little
Pussy Willow</i> are three books for children, written
in the intervals of more serious work which
included several other novels and some volumes
of sketches.</p>

<p>In all her work appears a warm love of humanity,
which she studied under many conditions.</p>

<p>Soon after the publication of <i>Uncle Tom's
Cabin</i> Mrs. Stowe accepted an invitation from
the Anti-Slavery Society of Glasgow to visit
Scotland; her reception was in reality an ovation
from the nation. At every railroad station she
had to make her way through the crowds that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg 201]</span>
had gathered to welcome her. Every city she
visited honored her with a public greeting, and
even her sight-seeing excursions to cathedrals
and places of interest were made the occasions
of demonstrations of joy from the crowds which
quickly gathered. From the nobility to the
peasants, who stood at their doors to see her pass
by, she was everywhere received as one who had
done noble work for the cause of freedom. In
England she met with the same enthusiasm, and,
both from England and Scotland she received
large sums of money to be used for the advancement
of the anti-slavery cause in America. Mrs.
Stowe has left a sketch of this pleasant episode in
her life in a little work called <i>Sunny Memories</i>.</p>

<p>Some years later she purchased a winter home
in Florida, and here she erected a building to be
used as church and school-house by the poorer inhabitants.
In this she conducted Sunday-school,
singing and sewing classes. Her pleasant experiences
in her Southern home are embodied in a
series of sketches called <i>Palmetto Leaves</i>.</p>

<p>On the seventieth anniversary of her birthday
her publishers arranged a garden party in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg 202]</span>
honor, to which were invited all the literary celebrities
of America. It calls up a pleasant picture
to think of her thus surrounded by the distinguished
men and women who had gathered to
do honor not only to her work for literature, but
to that nobility of soul that had made her long
life a service for others.</p>

<p>Whittier, Holmes, and many others contributed
poems on this occasion.</p>

<p>In American literature Mrs. Stowe stands as
its chief woman representative before the Civil
War, taking high place by right among the novelists
whose sphere is the presentation of national
life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL</h3>

<h4>1819-1892</h4>


<p>James Russell Lowell was born on the 22d
of February, 1819, at Cambridge, Mass. Fate
had willed that he, beyond all other writers, was
to preserve a certain phase of Yankee life and
make it the treasure of futurity, and the Cambridge
of his early boyhood was the best training
he could have received for such a mission.</p>

<p>The then unpretentious village, with its quiet
streets shaded with elms, lindens, and horse-chestnuts,
was revered throughout New England as
the home of Harvard College, but it was much
more than that. It was a little world in which
still lingered all the quaintness and simplicity of
early New England life, and Lowell, imbibing
these influences unconsciously in childhood, was
able afterward to reproduce their flavor in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg 204]</span>
literary work and thus preserve them from oblivion.
The birthplace of Lowell was Elmwood,
a charming country-seat formerly occupied by a
Tory tax-collector, who had emigrated on the outbreak
of the Revolution. It had a large, comfortable
house shaded by some of the Cambridge
elms, which Lowell characteristically remarks
were unable fortunately to emigrate with the tax-collector,
and the grounds were beautified by the
trees and flowers which were the delight of Dr.
Lowell, the poet's father.</p>

<p>In Cambridge streets were to be seen many of
the sights characteristic of New England village
life, suggesting still the village life of England
when Shakespeare was a boy. The coach rumbled
on its way to Boston, then a little journey
away, and old women gathered around the town
spring for their weekly washing of clothes. At
the inn were discussed all those questions of law,
religion, and politics that had not been settled at
the town-meeting, and the village barber-shop,
with its choice collection of rarities, had the dignity
of a museum. So fascinating was this place
that the boy who had to have his hair cut was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg 205]</span>
considered in luck, and was usually accompanied
by several of his play-fellows, who took this
means of feasting their eyes upon the barber's
treasures. Here were tomahawks, Indian bows
and arrows, New Zealand paddles and war-clubs,
beaks of albatrosses and penguins, and whales'
teeth; here were caged canaries and Java sparrows,
and one large cockatoo who, the barber
asserted, spoke Hottentot. Old Dutch prints
covered the walls, and the boys were barbered
under the pictured eyes of Frederick the Great
and Bonaparte. Perhaps the choicest treasure
was the glass model of a ship which the young
patrons valued at from one hundred to a thousand
dollars, the barber always acquiescing in
these generous valuations.</p>

<p>Once a year Cambridge celebrated a curious
festival called the Cornwallis, in which, in masquerade,
the town's people and country people
marched in grotesque processions in honor of
the surrender of Cornwallis. There was also
the annual muster, when the militia were drilled
under the eyes of their admiring wives, mothers,
and daughters. But the great event of the year
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg 206]</span>
at Cambridge was Commencement Day. The
entire community was aroused to do its best
in the celebration of this festival, the fame of
which had spread to every corner of New England.
The village was turned into a great fair,
where came every kind of vender and showman
to take the places assigned them by the town
constable; the gayly decorated booths extended
in an orderly row along the streets, and the entire
population gaped unrestrained at the giants,
fat women, flying horses, dwarfs, and mermaids,
only taking their eyes away long enough to
regale themselves with the ginger-beer and egg-pop,
sold on the stands or wheeled through the
streets in hand-carts by the enterprising venders.
The college exercises were dignified and grave,
as suited the traditions of its classic halls, but to
the boys who, like Lowell, had but this one
opportunity in the year, the marvels of the
booths and peep-shows made Commencement a
red-letter day.</p>

<p>Another charm of old Cambridge was found
in the river, which to the boyish imagination led
to fairy realms beyond. Once a year the sloop
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg 207]</span>
Harvard, owned by the college, voyaged to the
Maine coast to carry back the winter supply of
wood. Her going and coming was an event
in the life of the Cambridge schoolboy, who
watched the departure with wistful eyes, filled
the time of absence with romantic imaginings of
adventure in the perilous seas, and welcomed
her return with eager thirst for the news she
might bring. This humble little craft held no
secondary place in the interests of Lowell and
his mates. The heroic adventures of her crew
inspired the boys to bold ventures on the duck
pond, the admiral of the home-made fleet being
the young Dana, who delighted an after-generation
of boys by the story of his actual adventures
at sea in the fascinating book, <i>Two Years
Before the Mast</i>.</p>

<p>Lowell's first school was not far from Elmwood,
and although he did not distinguish himself
for scholarship, he went willingly every day,
returning rather more willingly, perhaps, and
sending always his boyish salutation of a cheery
whistle to his mother as he approached the house.
But in the daily life of the old village, and in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg 208]</span>
rambles through wood and by stream, he learned
lessons more valuable than those he found in
books. Nature, who appealed so strongly to his
heart, had made him a poet, and she took her
own way of teaching him the mysteries of his art.</p>

<p>Lowell enjoyed his singularly fortunate and
happy boyhood as only one gifted with a poetic
mind could. To him New England village life
revealed a charm that enabled him in after-days
to paint a picture of it as lovingly faithful as one
of Shakespeare's scenes. In his charming reminiscence,
<i>Cambridge Thirty Years Ago</i>, he has
preserved one of the dearest memories of his
boyhood. <i>Beaver Brook</i> and <i>Indian Summer
Reveries</i> are also transcriptions of those idyllic
days of his youth.</p>

<p>Lowell entered Harvard in his sixteenth year
and was graduated in his twentieth, during which
time he says he read everything except the
books in the college course. It was during
these years, however, that he studied the great
poets of the world, while romances, travels,
voyages, and history were added as a flavor to
his self-chosen course of study.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg 209]</span>

<p>Perhaps he showed the true bent of his mind
in his boyhood poem, addressed to the old horse-chestnuts,
whose arms twined themselves around
his study-room at home. He was class poet for
his year, but was not allowed to read his poem,
as he was at the time temporarily suspended
from the college. In this poem Lowell made
good-natured fun of Carlyle, Emerson, and
other philosophers, whose thought was just beginning
to influence their generation, thus hinting
the power which made him later the most
successful humorist of America.</p>

<p>After leaving college Lowell studied law
and was admitted to the bar, a profession which
he almost immediately saw would make him
only miserable, and which he soon left. In his
twenty-second year he published his first book
of verse under the title <i>A Year's Life</i>, a volume
which was mainly inspired by his admiration for
the woman who afterward became his wife, and
which gives indication of the power which was
developed later, though in the after-editions of
his works the poet discarded most of the productions
of that time. A little later Lowell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg 210]</span>
conceived the idea of starting a magazine, which
should rival in value and fame the celebrated
Philadelphia magazines, which were believed to
stand for the highest literary art in America.
The magazine was named <i>The Pioneer</i>, and its
editorship and ownership were shared with a
friend. It appeared in January, 1843, and ran
for three months, ending in dismal failure,
though the contributors numbered such names
as Poe, Elizabeth Barrett, Whittier, and the
artist Story. It was not until twelve years
later, when his own fame was well established,
that Lowell undertook the editorship
of another magazine, and put to practical use
his reserve talent for adapting and selecting
for popular favor the best literary work of the
time.</p>

<p>A year after the failure of <i>The Pioneer</i>, Lowell
published a second volume of poems. In
this collection occur the poems <i>The Legend of
Brittany</i>; <i>Prometheus</i>, a poem founded on the
old Greek myth of Prometheus, who incurs the
wrath of Jupiter by giving fire to mankind;
<i>The Heritage</i>, a stirring ballad, and <i>The Shepherd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg 211]</span>
of King Admetus</i>, embodying the myth of
the coming of Apollo to King Admetus and his
gift of poesy to the world. The volume heralded
the fame that Lowell was afterward to attain as
a poet.</p>

<p>In 1846 the Mexican war was the great political
question of the day, and the country was
divided in opinion as to whether the Government
had undertaken the war in a spirit of justice,
or merely for the sake of acquiring new
territory. The South mainly favored the war,
while a portion of the North opposed it on the
principle that the new territory would favor the
extension of slavery. There was much talk of
glory, and the heroes of the day were the generals
and soldiers who were winning laurels on
the Mexican battle-fields.</p>

<p>Lowell considered the war dishonorable and
opposed to the principles of liberty, and he took
a firm stand against it. He did this, not, as may
be said, in his own way, for the way was new to
him, but in a manner that turned the vaunted
heroism of the day into ridicule, and appealed to
the public conscience by its patriotism and honesty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg 212]</span>
Keeping his own personality in the background,
Lowell sent his wits roving into the
world of memory and brought from it a hero
who was destined to rival in fame the leader of
the Mexican campaigns. This hero possessed
the old courage, fire, and enthusiasm which had
braved the British in Revolutionary days. His
patriotism was a pure flame, his wisdom that of
the builders who had founded a commonwealth
of civil rights in the midst of the primeval forest;
his common-sense would have made him a king
in Yankeedom, and his humor was as grim as
that of the old Puritans, who believed in fighting
the devil with his own weapons. He came on
the scene dressed in homespun, and spoke the
homely dialect of New England, that singular
speech so unlike any other and which seems to
have had grafted upon the original English all
the eccentricities which made the Puritans a
peculiar people.</p>

<p>This singular figure which now attracted public
attention was first heard from in the columns of
the Boston <i>Courier</i>, as the author of a poem on
the subject of the raising of volunteers for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg 213]</span>
Mexican War. The poem was written in the
Yankee dialect and, it was stated, had been sent
to the office by the poet's father, Ezekiel Biglow.
The verses rang with New England canniness,
and the familiar dialect acquired a dignity never
before acknowledged. Scholars, statesmen, critics,
and the public at large, after a first few puzzling
moments grasped the full force of the new
crusade, and the standard-bearer and author,
Hosea Biglow, became the most talked about
man of the time. Previous to this society had
laughed at the reformers. Now people laughed
with Hosea at the supporters of the war. From
this time Hosea Biglow's sayings and doings
were the most popular comment on the political
situation. Whatever happened was made the
subject of a poem by Hosea, expressing sometimes
his own opinions and sometimes the opinions
of Parson Wilbur, John P. Robinson, and
other persons introduced into the series. These
poems met with tremendous success. Wherever
it was possible they were set to music and sung
with all the abandon of a popular ballad. There
is a story told to the effect that John P. Robinson
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg 214]</span>
grew so tired of hearing the song in which
he is introduced that he fled across the sea in
despair. This brought no relief, however, for
the street gamins of London and the travelling
American and Englishman, wherever he could
be found, unconsciously greeted his ears with the
rollicking refrain:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"But John P.</p>
<p class="i2">Robinson, he</p>
<p>Sez they didn't know everythin'</p>
<p class="i2">Down in Judee."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Among the political poems occurs in "The
Notices of the Press," which form the introduction,
the exquisite love-poem, <i>The Courtin'</i>.</p>

<p>In wit, scholarship, and knowledge of human
nature, the Biglow papers are acknowledged as a
classic, and the future student of American literature
will be ever grateful for this preservation
of the Yankee dialect by New England's greatest
poet.</p>

<p>Lowell's next important contribution to literature
was the publication of the poem, <i>The Vision
of Sir Launfal</i>. This beautiful poem, in which
in a vision a young knight arms himself and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg 215]</span>
starts in search of the Holy Grail, reads like a
sacred legend of the Middle Ages. It is full of
the pious spirit of the old monks who still
believed the story of the existence of the Holy
Grail, and the possibility of its recovery by the
pure in heart. This story, which has appealed
to the art of every age, found in Lowell a poet
worthy of its expression, and one who has transcribed
the mysticism of the past into the vital
charity of the present. Though a dream of the
Old World, it is still the New England poet who
translates it, as may be seen from the bits of
landscape shining through it. Glimpses of the
northern winter; of the wind sweeping down
from the heights, and of the little brook that</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Heard it and built a roof</p>
<p>'Neath which he could house him winter-proof,"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>show the poet in his mood of loving reminiscence.</p>

<p>In his poems <i>Prometheus</i>, <i>The Legend of Brittany</i>,
<i>Rh&oelig;cus</i>, and the collection known as <i>Under
the Willows</i>, which includes the <i>Commemoration
Ode</i>, Lowell shows his highest point as a poet,
which is also reached in <i>The Cathedral</i>. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg 216]</span>
was a large and generous spirit, which found no
experience or condition of life trivial. He was
in sympathy with nature and with the aims and
happiness of humanity. The affectionate side of
his nature is shown in many of his poems, one of
the most beautiful being that which is expressed
in <i>The First Snowfall</i>, a tender and sacred
memory of one of the poet's children.</p>

<p>The <i>Commemoration Ode</i>, written in honor of
the Harvard graduates who fell in the War for
the Union, was read by Lowell July 21, 1865,
at the Commemoration Service held in their
memory. No hall could hold the immense audience
which assembled to hear their chosen poet
voice the grief of the nation over its slain in the
noblest poem produced by the war. To those
present the scene, which has become historic,
was rendered doubly impressive from the fact
that Lowell mourned in his verse many of his
own kindred.</p>

<p><i>A Fable for Critics</i> is a satire in verse upon
the leading authors of America. The first bit
was written and despatched to a friend without
any thought of publication. The fable was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg 217]</span>
continued in the same way until the daily bits were
sent to a publisher by the friend, who thought
the matter too good for private delectation only.
In this production Lowell satirizes all the writers
of the day, himself included, with a wit so
pungent and so sound a taste that the criticism
has appealed to the succeeding generation, which
has in nearly every case vindicated the poet's
judgment of his contemporaries. The authorship
remained for some time unknown, and was
only disclosed by Lowell when claimed by others.</p>

<p>Besides his poetry Lowell produced several
volumes of charming prose. Among these is
<i>The Fireside Travels</i>, which contains his description
of Cambridge in his boyhood; <i>Among My
Books</i>, and <i>My Study Windows</i>, which contain
literary criticism of the choicest sort, the poet
easily taking rank as one of the foremost critics
of his time. Throughout his prose we find the
same feeling for nature and love for humanity
that distinguishes his poetry. His whole literary
career was but an outgrowth of his own
broad, sympathetic, genial nature, interwoven
with the acquirements of the scholar.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg 218]</span>

<p>Lowell was for a large part of his life Professor
of Modern Languages and Belles-lettres at
Harvard. Soon after its beginning he became
editor of the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, and he also was
for a time one of the editors of the <i>North
American Review</i>.</p>

<p>Outside of his literary life he was known as a
diplomat who served his country with distinction
as minister, successively, to Spain and to
England. Though finding congenial surroundings
in foreign lands, Lowell was always pre-eminently
an American; one who, even in his
country's darkest hour, saw promise of her glory,
and to whom her fame was ever the dearest sentiment
of his heart. Most of his life was spent
in his old home at Elmwood, where he died in
1892.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>FRANCIS PARKMAN</h3>

<h4>1823-1893</h4>


<p>At twelve o'clock on a summer night, nearly
a half century ago, a young man of twenty-three
stood in the shadow of a great Indian camp
watching intently the scene before him. On the
farther side of the camp a number of Indians
were gathered about the fire, which threw into
relief their strong, handsome frames, for they
were all young and formed, as they stood there,
the hope and ambition of their tribe. Suddenly
a loud chant broke the silence of the night, and
at the same time the young braves began circling
around the fire in a grotesque, irregular kind of
dance. The chant was now interrupted by bursts
of sharp yells, and the motions of the dancers,
now leaping, now running, again creeping slyly,
suggested the movements of some stealthy animal;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg 220]</span>
this was, in fact, what was intended, for
the young warriors were the "Strong Hearts"
of the Dacotahs, an association composed of the
bravest youths of the tribe, whose <i>totem</i> or tutelary
spirit was the fox, in whose honor they were
now celebrating one of their dances.</p>

<p>The stranger, who stood looking on at a little
distance away, since the superstitions of the tribe
would not allow him to approach too near the
scene of the solemnities, was Francis Parkman,
a Harvard graduate, who had left civilization for
the purpose of studying the savage form of
Indian life face to face.</p>

<p>Parkman was born in Boston in 1823. He
was noted as a child who threw himself body and
soul into whatever happened to be the pursuit of
the hour, and thus illustrated even in childhood
the most striking feature of his character. During
a residence in the country from his eighth to his
twelfth year he was seized with a passion for
natural history, and bent all his energies to collecting
eggs, insects, reptiles, and birds, and to
trapping squirrels and woodchucks, practising in
the meantime shooting in Indian fashion with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg 221]</span>
bow and arrow. At twelve he forsook natural
history and found chemistry the only interest in
life. For four years longer he now secluded
himself largely from family life and youthful
companions, while he experimented in his amateur
laboratory. Acids, gases, specific gravity,
and chemical equations were the only delight
of his life, and he pursued his experiments
with all the ardor of the old seekers of the
philosopher's stone. But at sixteen the charms of
chemistry faded, and he became again a haunter
of the woods, but was saved in the end from becoming
a naturalist by an equally strong passion
for history, a passion so real that at eighteen he
had chosen his life-work, that of historian of the
French in the New World. With the idea of
his work had also come the conception of its
magnitude, and he calmly looked forward to
twenty years of hard and exacting labor before
realizing his hopes. Still, mastered by the spirit
of thoroughness, he spent all his vacations in
Canada, following in the footsteps of the early
French settlers. Here in the forest, he slept
on the earth with no covering but a blanket,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg 222]</span>
exhausted his guides with long marches, and
exposed his health by stopping neither for heat
nor rain. Fascinated by the visions of forest
life and with the pictures which the old stories
called up, Parkman entered upon the literary
preparation for his work with zeal. Indian history
and ethnology were included in his college
course, while he spent many hours that should
have been devoted to rest in studying the great
English masters of style. He was graduated
at twenty-one, and after a short trip to Europe
started for the Western plains to begin his historical
studies from nature.</p>

<p>For months he and a college friend had followed
the wanderings of a portion of the Dacotahs in
their journey across the Western prairies to the
Platte River, where they were to be joined by
thousands of others of their tribe, and take part
in the extermination of the Snake Indians, their
bitter enemies. They had suffered from the heat
and the dust of the desert; they had hunted buffalo
among the hills and ravines of the Platte
border, and had slept night after night in open
camps while wolves and panthers crawled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg 223]</span>
dangerously near. To all intents and purposes their
life was that of the Indian of the plains, an alien
to civilization, a hunter of buffalo, and an enemy
to all human beings except those of his own
nation.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1846, three years before the
discovery of gold in California, and the great
West was still a land of forests, and the home
of wandering tribes of Indians. From the Mississippi
to the Pacific coast the country was entirely
unsettled, with the exception of a few military
forts and trading-posts. Here the Indian
lived as his race had lived from time immemorial.
Dressed in his robe of skins, with his gay moccasins
on his feet, his dog-skin quiver at his back,
and his powerful bow slung across his shoulder,
the Dacotah of that day was a good specimen of
a race that has almost disappeared. The only
two objects in life were war and the hunt, and
he was ready at a moment's notice to strike his
tent and engage in either.</p>

<p>Six or eight times during the year the Great
Spirit was called upon, fasts were made, and war
parades celebrated preliminary to attacks upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg 224]</span>
other tribes, while during the remainder of the
time he hunted the buffalo which supplied him
with every necessity of life. The coverings for
their tents, their clothing, beds, ropes, coverings
for their saddles, canoes, water-jars, food, and
fuel, were all obtained from this animal, which
also served as a means of trading with the posts.
The Indians had obtained rifles from the whites
in a few cases, but they still largely used the bow
and arrow, with which their predecessors on the
plains had hunted the mammoth and mastodon
in prehistoric ages. Their arrows were tipped
with flint and stone, and their stone hammers
were like those used by the savages of the
Danube and Rhine when Europe was still uncivilized.</p>

<p>While civilization had laid a chain of cities
and towns around the borders of the continent,
the American Indian of the interior remained
exactly as his forefathers had been. And it was
to study this curious specimen of humanity,
whose like had faded from almost every other
part of the world, that Parkman had come
among them. He wished to reveal the Indian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg 225]</span>
in his true character, and he thought he
could only do this by living the Indian life. And
so, for six months, he shared their lodges, their
feasts, hunts, and expeditions of war. He became
acquainted with their beliefs in the Great
Spirit, the father of the universe, and in the
lesser spirits which controlled the winds and rain,
and which were found inhabiting the bodies of
the lower animals. He learned to know the
curious character of their "medicine-men" and
their witch-doctors, and all their strange superstitions
regarding the mysteries of life and death
and the origin of man.</p>

<p>Suffering constantly from physical ills, and in
danger of death at any moment from the treachery
of the red men, Parkman yet was able to
maintain his position among them with dignity,
and to be acknowledged worthy of their hospitality,
and he took advantage of this to make his
study of them thorough. The Dacotahs were a
branch of the Sioux, one of the fiercest of the
tribes of the plains. In his journey with them
Parkman traversed the regions of the Platte,
which was one of the best known routes to Oregon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg 226]</span>
and California. Frequent parties of emigrants
passed them on their way to new homes,
and those, with the traders' posts and occasional
bands of hunters, gave them their only glimpses
of white faces. Reaching the upper waters of
the Platte, they branched off for a hunting trip
to the Black Hills, and then returning, made the
passage of the Rocky Mountains, gained the
head-waters of the Arkansas, and so returned
to the settlements.</p>

<p>It was a trip full of danger and adventure,
but Parkman had gained what he wanted&mdash;a
picture of Indian life still preserved in the solitudes
of the plains and mountains as inviolate as
the rivers and rocks themselves. A few years
later the discovery of gold in California changed
this condition almost as if by magic. The plains
and mountains became alive with unnumbered
hosts of emigrants on their way to the gold
fields. Cities and towns sprung up where before
Indian lodges and buffalo herds had held
sway. Year by year the Indians changed in
character and habits, adopting in some measure
the dress of the whites and their manner of living.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg 227]</span>
The true Indian of the plains passed out
of history, and but for Parkman's visit, even the
memory of him as an example of the picturesque
freedom of savage life, might have been
lost.</p>

<p>A year after his return to the east Parkman
published an account of his adventures in the
<i>Knickerbocker Magazine</i>, under the title <i>The
Oregon Trail</i>, the name by which the old route
was generally known. Later on these sketches
appeared in book form. They formed Parkman's
first book and indicated the scheme of
his life-work.</p>

<p>Parkman had elaborated his first idea, and
now intended writing an account of the history
of the French influence in America from the
earliest visits of Verazzani and Jacques Cartier,
down to the time when the English drove out
the French from Canada and the Mississippi
Valley, and laid the foundations of what was
destined to be the American Republic.</p>

<p>His second book, <i>The Conspiracy of Pontiac</i>,
published five years after his adventures among
the Sioux, deals with the last act of the struggle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg 228]</span>
between France and England. This book appeared
thus early in the series because at that
time, on account of ill-health, Parkman could
not begin any work of vast magnitude such as
would require exhaustive research.</p>

<p>The conspiracy of Pontiac, a chief of the Ottawas,
who formed a confederation of the tribes
to drive the English from the forts near the
Great Lakes, was a theme complete in itself, and
yet one that could easily supplement any series
dealing with similar subjects. Parkman visited
the scene of Pontiac's exploits, talked with the
descendants of the tribes which still lingered
around the Great Lakes, which then formed the
outposts of the English, and stored his mind
with such local traditions and color as would
give character to the narrative. The book was
written through the aid of readers and an amanuensis,
whose task it was to gather the notes,
which Parkman sifted until ready for dictation.
It dealt with one of the most picturesque episodes
of the French and Indian War, and the
character of Pontiac&mdash;brave, patriotic, and ready
for any fate&mdash;was drawn with a master-touch.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg 229]</span>

<p>Fourteen years passed by before Parkman
presented another volume of the series which he
intended should illustrate the complete history
of the French in America. This volume was
called the <i>Pioneers of France in the New World</i>,
and opens the theme with a description of the
early voyagers, thus making it in point of place
the first book of the series.</p>

<p>His books, which appeared at different times
after the <i>Pioneers of France</i>, under the titles
<i>The Jesuits of North America</i>; <i>The Discovery
of the Great West</i>; <i>The Old Regime in Canada</i>;
<i>A Half Century of Conflict</i>; and <i>Montcalm
and Wolfe</i>, indicate each in turn the character
of its scope.</p>

<p>They tell the history of the French race in
America for over two hundred years, beginning
with the old voyagers who sought in America a
region of romance and mystery which should
rival the fairy realms of the poets of the Middle
Ages, and ending with the last efforts of the
Indians to recover their land from the grasp of
the hated English.</p>

<p>Through all this period the Indians had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg 230]</span>
regarded the French as friends. Jesuit missionaries
had penetrated the wilds of the Mississippi,
and had brought to the tribes on its banks the
message of peace and brotherly love. They
spread the story of Christ from Carolina to the
St. Lawrence, and from the Mississippi to the
Atlantic. They lived the Indian life, dwelling
in lodges, eating the Indian food, conforming as
much as possible to the Indian habits, and retaining,
in their geographical descriptions, the Indian
names of the lakes and rivers, so dear to the savage
heart.</p>

<p>They made, in the main, a peaceful conquest
of the country, and they won the natives to such
a degree that in the contest with the English
which ensued the Indian remained throughout
the firm friend and ally of the French. The
English had thus two enemies to deal with
instead of one, the military knowledge of the
French being in every case strengthened by the
subtle and savage modes of Indian warfare.
This state of things kept the final issue doubtful,
even though the English won victory after
victory, for the taking of a fort and the slaughter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg 231]</span>
or capture of the garrison might be followed at
any time by a murderous night attack from the
savage allies, who ignored the civilized methods
of war and would never acknowledge defeat.</p>

<p>In this work Parkman not only aimed at the
history of the actual struggle between France
and England for the possession of North America,
but he also wished to present clearly the
story of the French alone, as they appeared in
their character of settlers and conquerors of
uncivilized lands.</p>

<p>In the vivid pictures with which Parkman
tells this story of their life in the New World,
we see a strong contrast to the Spanish power
in South America, as illustrated in the pages of
history. The Spaniards conquered a race already
far advanced in civilization, reduced it to slavery,
destroyed its race characteristics, and made everything
else bend to their insatiate love of gold.</p>

<p>Very different was the conduct of the French
in their treatment of the savage tribes that they
found inhabiting the primeval forests of North
America. The Jesuit missionaries and the persecuted
Huguenots alike approached the Indian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg 232]</span>
with one message, that of Christian love and
faith in the brotherhood of man. To them the
dark child of the forests, savage in nature, untamed
in habit, was still a brother who must be
lifted to a higher life. And to do this they lived
among them as teachers and advisers rather than
as conquerors.</p>

<p>In these pages all the heroes of the French
occupation appear before us as in their daily life
with the Indians: Marquette, La Salle, Tonti,
Front&#233;nac, Du Gorgues&mdash;whose visit of vengeance
is so well described that he is forever remembered
by the Indians as an avenger of their
race&mdash;and the men of lesser note. We have
also a picture of the Hurons, the Iroquois, and
other tribes as they appeared to the early French
settlers; and in fact Parkman has left no phase
or detail of the movement untouched. It was a
vast undertaking, and carried out in the midst
of many difficulties, and its completion placed
Parkman's name among the greatest historians
of all time.</p>

<p>Parkman suffered from ill-health from his
earliest years throughout his life, and to this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg 233]</span>
was added partial blindness, which made his literary
work as great a task as that of Prescott.
Very often he was interrupted for months and
years by illness, and in the main he had to
depend upon the help of others in collecting his
material; but his purpose never faltered, and the
end was brilliant with success.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES</h3>

<h4>1809-1894</h4>


<p>Among the boys most familiar with the
scenes described in Lowell's recollections of his
youth was Oliver Wendell Holmes, the son of
the pastor of the First Congregational Church at
Cambridge. Holmes was ten years older than
Lowell, but Cambridge altered little between
the birthtimes of the two poets, and in the writings
of both are embalmed many loving memories
of the old village.</p>

<p>In his reminiscence of the famous Commencement
week, so faithfully described by Lowell,
Holmes says, "I remember that week well, for
something happened to me once at that time,
namely, I was born." Many after-touches show
us how the great week possessed for Holmes
the same magic charm it held for Lowell. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg 235]</span>
wonders of the menagerie where he beheld for
the first time a live tiger, the side-show where
he enjoyed the delights of Punch and Judy, and
gazed with awe at the biggest live fat boy known
to showmen, and the marvels of the toy-counter,
over which hung the inscription,</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Look, but handle not,"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>shared honors with the Governor's parade, and
Commencement exercises, and in fact far out-ranked
them with Holmes, who confessed that
he would willingly have stayed from morning
till night viewing their delights, and declared
that the sound of the tent-raising on the Common
the night before the show began could be
compared to nothing but the evening before
Agincourt!</p>

<p>Holmes was born in August, when, he tells
us in one of his charming essays, the meadows
around Cambridge were brilliant with the cardinal
flower, and blossoming buckwheat covered
the fields, while the bayberry, barberry, sweetfern,
and huckleberry made delightful retreats
for the small boy of the neighborhood. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg 236]</span>
same essay he describes the old garden of the
parsonage, with its lilac-bushes, hyacinths, tulips,
peonies, and hollyhocks, its peaches, nectarines,
and white grapes, growing in friendly companionship
with the beets, carrots, onions, and
squashes, while the old pear-tree in the corner,
called by Holmes "the moral pear-tree," because
its fruit never ripened, taught him one of his
earliest lessons. Bits of reminiscence like this
scattered throughout the pages of Holmes enable
us to reconstruct the scenes of his youth
and to follow him from the time he was afraid
of the masts of the sloops down by the bridge,
"being a very young child," through all the
years of his boyhood. The parsonage was an
old-fashioned gambrel-roofed house, which
Holmes recurs to again and again with loving
remembrance. The rooms were large and light
and had been the scenes of stirring events in
other days.</p>

<p>On the study floor could still be seen the
dents of the muskets stacked there in Revolutionary
times, and an old family portrait in one
of the upper rooms still bore the sword-thrusts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg 237]</span>
of the British soldiers. A certain dark store-room
contained a pile of tables and chairs, which
to the child's fancy seemed to have rushed in there
to hide, and tumbled against one another as people
do when frightened. Another store-room held an
array of preserve-jars containing delicious sweets;
before the door of this room he would stand with
one eye glued to the keyhole while his childish
imagination revelled in the forbidden luxuries.</p>

<p>The house had also a ghostly garret about
which clustered many legends, and these in connection
with certain patches of sand bare of
grass and vine and called the Devil's Footsteps,
which might have been seen around the neighborhood,
tended to make the bedtime hour a
season of dread to the imaginative boy, who saw
shadowy red-coats in every dark corner, and
with every unfamiliar noise expected even more
uncanny visitors.</p>

<p>Outside was the old garden, sweet and sunny,
and close to it the friendly wall of a neighbor's
house, up which climbed a honeysuckle which
stretched so far back into memory that the child
thought it had been there always, "like the sky
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg 238]</span>
and stars," and on the whole the atmosphere of
the old home was most wholesome.</p>

<p>When Holmes was but a little child he was
sent to Dame Prentice's school, where he studied
the primer and spent his leisure moments in
falling in love with his pretty girl schoolmates
or playing with certain boyish toys which were
always confiscated sooner or later by the school-mistress,
and went to help fill a large basket
which stood ready to receive such treasures. At
ten years of age he began attendance at the
Cambridgeport school, where he had for schoolmates
Margaret Fuller and Richard Henry
Dana, and where he remained for some years.</p>

<p>Holmes says that in these years of his childhood
every possible occasion for getting a crowd
together was made the most of&mdash;school anniversaries
and town centennials; Election Day,
which came in May, when everyone carried a
bunch of lilacs and the small boys ate "election
buns" of such size that the three regular meals
had to be omitted; Fourth of July, a very grand
holiday indeed, when the festivities were opened
by the Governor; Commencement Week, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg 239]</span>
its glories of shows and dancing on the Common,
were each in turn made seasons of joy for
the youthful denizens of Cambridge and Boston.
Perhaps the most gratifying of all the holidays
was the old-fashioned Thanksgiving, when even
the sermon, though of greater length than usual,
"had a subdued cheerfulness running through
it," which kept reminding the children of the
turkey and oyster-sauce, the plum-pudding,
pumpkin-pie, oranges, almonds, and shagbarks
awaiting them at home, and the chink of the
coin in the contribution-boxes was but a joyous
prelude to the music of roasting apples and nuts.</p>

<p>Holmes left the Cambridgeport school to
enter Phillips Academy, and has left us a charming
account of this first visit to Andover, whither
he went in a carriage with his parents, becoming
more and more homesick as the time came for
parting, until finally he quite broke down and
for a few days was utterly miserable. But he had
happy days at Andover, and revisiting the place
in after years he describes himself as followed
by the little ghost of himself, who went with
him to the banks of the Showshine and Merrimac;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg 240]</span>
to the old meeting-house, the door of which
was bullet-riddled by the Indians; to the school-rooms
where he had recited Euclid and Virgil; to
the base-ball field, and to the great bowlder upon
which the boys cracked nuts, proving such a
faithful guide that when the day was over
Holmes almost committed the folly of asking at
the railroad office for two tickets back to Boston.
Perhaps of all the celebrated men who have
been pupils at the famous school no one held it
more lovingly in his heart than he who turned
back after so many years of success to pay this
loving tribute to its memory.</p>

<p>The stay at Andover lasted but a year, during
which time Holmes discovered that he could
write verse, and gained a little reputation thereby,
which led to his being made class-poet when he
left school to enter Harvard, in his sixteenth year.
Throughout his college life he kept his reputation
as a maker of humorous verse, and was perhaps
the most popular member of the various societies
and clubs for which Harvard was noted. He
was graduated in his twentieth year, and within a
year of this time had decided to study medicine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg 241]</span>
and after a two years' course in Boston went
abroad to attend lectures in Paris and Edinburgh.</p>

<p>But the practice of medicine included but a
few years of Holmes's life, as in 1847 he accepted
the chair of anatomy and physiology at Harvard,
holding the position for thirty-five years.</p>

<p>During his years of study and practice,
Holmes had gained gradually the reputation of
a clever literary man whose name was familiar
to the readers of the best periodicals of the day.
This reputation began with the publication of a
poem, <i>Old Ironsides</i>, which was inspired by the
proposition to destroy, as of no further use, the
old frigate Constitution, which had done such
glorious service during the war of 1812. These
verses, which begin the literary life of Holmes,
ring with a noble patriotism which flashed its
fire into the hearts of thousands of his countrymen
and made the author's name almost a household
word. They were published originally in
the Boston <i>Advertiser</i>, but so furious was the
storm aroused that within a short time they had
been copied in newspapers all over the land,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg 242]</span>
printed on handbills that placarded the walls,
and circulated in the streets from hand to hand.
It was a satisfaction to the young patriot to
know that his appeal had not been made in vain,
and that the old ship was allowed to rest secure
in the keeping of a grateful nation. A few
years later Holmes published his first volume of
poems, collected from various periodicals, and
gained medals for some essays on medical subjects.
For many years after this his literary
work consisted chiefly of fugitive poems, written
very often for special occasions, such as class anniversaries
and dinners.</p>

<p>It was, however, by the publication of a series
of essays in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, which was
started in 1857, with James Russell Lowell as
editor, that Holmes began his career as the
household intimate of every lover of reading in
America. These essays, which are now collected
in four volumes, appeared in the <i>Atlantic</i>, at intervals
between the series, between 1857 and
1859, and thus cover almost the entire period of
the author's life as a man of letters.</p>

<p>The first series&mdash;<i>The Autocrat at the Breakfast-Table</i>&mdash;struck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg 243]</span>
the key-note for the rest, a
note which showed the author's heart attuned in
its broad yet subtle sympathy to the heart of his
race, and created such a friendship as rarely exists
between author and reader. In the Autocrat
Holmes introduces a variety of characters which
at intervals flit throughout the rest of the series.</p>

<p>The papers are thrown into the form of talks
at the breakfast-table between the author and his
fellow-boarders, and so strong is the personal
flavor that they seem to the reader like the
home-letters of an absent member of the family.
The landlady and her son, Benjamin Franklin,
the sharp-eyed spinster in black, the young fellow
"whose name seems to be John and nothing
else," and the school-teacher, appear and disappear
side by side with Little Boston, Iris, and
the characters of the other series, and emphasize
the life-likeness of the whole. It never seems in
reading these papers that the <i>dramatis person&#230;</i>
are anything else than living human beings, with
whom Holmes actually converses around the
boarding-house table or at his own fireside. The
series, besides <i>The Autocrat at the Breakfast-Table</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg 244]</span>
includes <i>The Professor at the Breakfast-Table</i>,
<i>The Poet at the Breakfast-Table</i>,
and <i>Over the Teacups</i>, the last being separated
from the others by an interval of thirty years.</p>

<p>One of the chief charms of these essays is
found in the bits of biography which stamp them
in so many cases as personal history. One may
read here the nature of the man who could thus
step back into the realm of childhood, appreciate
the delicate grace of girlhood, enjoy the robust
enthusiasm of young manhood, and pause with
reverent sympathy before the afflicted. Behind
each character portrayed one feels the healthful,
generous throb of a humanity to which no ambition
of soul could seem foreign or no defect appeal
in vain. Scattered throughout the volumes
are many charming verses, to some of which
Holmes owes his fame as a poet. In <i>The Autocrat
at the Breakfast-Table</i> occurs, among
others, the celebrated poem, <i>The Chambered
Nautilus</i>, which shows perhaps the highest point
to which Holmes's art as a poet has reached.
This poem, founded upon the many-chambered
shell of the pearly nautilus, is made by the poet to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg 245]</span>
illustrate the progress of the soul in its journey
through life; the spiritual beauty of the verse
shows it a genuine reflection of that soul illumination
which made of the poet's Puritan ancestors
a peculiar people. Many other poems bear
the mark of this spiritual insight, and stamp the
author as possessing the highest poetic sense.
But it is perhaps in his humorous poems that
Holmes has appealed to the greatest number of
readers. Throughout the verse of this class runs
the genuine Yankee humor, allied to high scholarship
and the finest literary art.</p>

<p>Many of the verses seem but an echo in rhyme
of the half-serious, half-whimsical utterances of
the Breakfast-Table Series. Who but the Autocrat
himself could have given literary form to the
exquisite pathos of The <i>Last Leaf</i>, the delicious
quaintness of <i>Dorothy Q</i>, or the solemn drollery
of <i>The Katy Did</i>?</p>

<p>Many of the more popular poems are simply
<i>vers d'occasion</i>, written for some class reunion,
college anniversary, or state dinner. These
poems, collected under the title <i>Poems of the
Class of '29</i>, show Holmes in his most charming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg 246]</span>
mood of reminiscence. Through all his poetry
shines here and there an intense sympathy with
nature, for running side by side with his appreciation
of human interests we see ever that deep
love of nature which is the mark of the true
poet. Trees and flowers, the seasons, the meadows,
rivers, clouds, and the enchanting mysteries
of twilight touch his heart to sympathetic vibrations,
and their beauty enters into and becomes
a part of himself. In this sense some of his
most charming recollections cease to be merely
remembrance; they are the very air and sunlight
which he breathed and which became incorporated
into his being. Thus the old garden whose
fragrance lingers so loving in his memory and is
enshrined with such tender grace in his pages is
not a description, but a breath of that far-away
childhood which still shines for him immortally
beautiful; and the fire-flies flitting across the
darkened meadows bring once again to his mind
the first flash of insight into the wonder and
meaning of the night.</p>

<p>In some charming pages he has told us of his
love for trees, particularly of the old elms which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg 247]</span>
are the pride of the New England villages, and
in equally poetic vein he has emphasized the
beauty of the pond-lily, the cardinal flower, the
huckleberry pasture, and the fields of Indian
corn.</p>

<p>Dr. Holmes is also known as a novelist as
well as essayist and poet. His three novels,
<i>Elsie Venner</i>, <i>The Guardian Angel</i>, and <i>A
Mortal Antipathy</i>, are undoubtedly the results
of his experience as a physician, for each in turn
is founded upon some mental trait which sets
the hero or heroine apart from the rest of mankind.
In the treatment of these characteristics
Holmes has made apparent the powerful effect
of heredity upon the life of the human being.
These novels are chiefly valuable as character-studies
by an earnest student of moral science
whose literary bias tempted him to throw them
into the form of fiction. While touched with
the true Holmes flavor, they cannot be called
fiction of the highest order nor do they emphasize
Holmes's place in literature. They seem rather
to show his versatility as a writer and to illustrate
his familiarity with those subtle problems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg 248]</span>
of character that have always puzzled mankind.</p>

<p>Holmes's medical and literary essays, poems,
novels, and other miscellany have been collected
in thirteen volumes, the last of which,
<i>Over the Teacups</i>, appeared but a short time
before his death.</p>

<p>He spent most of his life in Boston, his home
there being the favorite meeting-place for the
most distinguished of his countrymen and a recognized
rallying-point for foreign guests. He
was the last of that brilliant circle which made
New England famous as the literary centre of
America; in many senses he combined the excellences
which have given American letters
their place in the literature of the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beside the writers who founded American
literature must be placed many others whose
work belongs to the same period. In history
and biography, besides the work of the great
historians, we have Hildreth's <i>History of the
United States</i>, Lossing's <i>Field Book of the Revolution</i>,
Schoolcraft's studies and researches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg 249]</span>
among the Indian tribes, the carefully written
biographies of Sparks, the Peter Parley and
Abbott stories for the young, and numerous
other contributions which throw valuable light
upon the early history of the United States.</p>

<p>In fiction the pictures of Southern life by
Sims, and the romances of Dutch life in New
York by Hoffman, preserve the colonial traditions,
and with many other writers of lesser note
supplement the work of the great novelists.</p>

<p>The philosophy of Emerson has found expression
in the writings of Bronson Alcott, Theodore
Parker, and Margaret Fuller. In poetry,
the still honored names of Fitz-Greene Halleck,
Joseph Rodman Drake, Elizabeth Kinney, Alice
and Ph&oelig;be Cary illustrate the place that they
held in the popular heart. Chief among these
minor singers stands John Howard Payne, whose
immortal song has found a home in nearly every
land.</p>
